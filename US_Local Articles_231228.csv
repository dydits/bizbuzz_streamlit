The family’s unit is one of four at the Balfour Chastain Apartments on Roswell Road that was damaged from smoke and water as firefighters worked to put out the early morning blaze. Sixteen people were displaced.

The fire appears to have started in the bedroom of a unit that had been sublet without the knowledge of management, Sandy Springs Mayor Rusty Paul told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Monday.

“The leaseholder has been identified, but we have not been able to make contact,” he said in an email.

The Red Cross assisted residents with finding alternate lodging.

Lara and her family have were put into another unit in the complex, and were in the process of moving their remaining belongings there around 10 a.m. Monday, when other families across metro Atlanta were opening presents. Only her kitchen was spared, she said.

“We are sad, but we can handle it,” she said.

Another overnight blaze in southwest Atlanta killed two people over the weekend.

Lara encouraged others to be wary of lights on Christmas trees or candles this holiday season.

“Be safe in your home and be alert. Be good people,” she said. “You know you can lose everything in one second.”"

This birth has been long-awaited news for many months. We have had many exciting developments in our rhino population over the past year,” said Raymond B. King, President and CEO, in a news release Monday.

Southern white rhinos are the largest of the five rhino species, with newborns weighing 100 to 150 pounds at birth. White rhino pregnancies are also among the animal kingdom’s longest, averaging anywhere between 16 and 18 months.

The Animal Care and Veterinary Teams at Zoo Atlanta first detected Kiazi’s pregnancy in the spring.

The species is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Southern white rhinos are especially vulnerable because they often travel in herds in the wild, making them easy targets for poachers who want their horns.

Southern white rhinos are not actually white, despite their name. The moniker is believed to have originated with the Afrikaans word wyd, meaning “wide” — a reference to the shape of white rhinos’ upper lips.

Kiazi, 22, has previously given birth to two living offspring at another organization prior to coming to Zoo Atlanta in 2021. The calf is the first offspring for Mumbles, the 12-year-old father. The pair was recommended to breed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ White Rhino Species Survival Plan, which seeks to maintain healthy, genetically diverse and self-sustaining animal populations in professional human care.

“All rhino species are currently in peril, and as stewards of this brand-new ambassador here in Atlanta, we also have a responsibility to do all we can to raise awareness of the status of wild rhinos,” King stated. “If there is a special connection that our members and guests can make with Kiazi and her calf, this is a connection that can translate to conservation action.”

Zoo Atlanta has been expanding its white rhino family. In October 2023, they welcomed 17-year-old female Dakari.

Kiazi is providing appropriate maternal care and the calf seems healthy and strong, Zoo Atlanta reported Monday. The two will have an opportunity to continue to bond behind the scenes before entering the rhino habitat. They’ll be introduced to Mumbles sometime in 2024."

So there, sitting in his pickup truck with Faught, the seed that sprouted Trees for Tuition was planted.

The childhood friends turned college roommates have since graduated from the University of Georgia and now run six Christmas tree lots across metro Atlanta employing more than 100 people, most of whom are high schoolers and college students. They’ve also launched a scholarship fund to give back to the community that once supported them.

But when they first ventured into the Christmas tree business, it was just the two of them. To start, Johnson said they bought 30 trees from a wholesaler and stored them in his mother’s backyard until they had buyers.

“We’d throw them in the back of my truck and drive around to different houses,” he said.

“That’s how we got the attention of our first customers, and most of those people still shop with us today,” Fought chimed in.

Those trees were taking up a lot of space in the yard, though, and after two years, “(my mom) was like, ‘Y’all gotta get out of here,’” Johnson said with a chuckle.

That was the push the college freshmen needed to open their first Trees for Tuition lot. It was on Arizona Avenue by the soccer fields in Edgewood — a lot they still operate today. And the Virginia-Highland lot? That is theirs now, too.

As the years went on, the friends continued juggling their increasing college responsibilities with their growing business. That often meant study sessions doubled as planning meetings — deciding how many trees to buy, when to start selling, what sizes people would want. And as they gained more experience in their areas of study — finance and marketing — they realized they could make a living with the business they’d created.

In 2020, a year before graduation, the duo launched their website and made their biggest purchase yet: 500 trees, which they said sold out before December. They typically start selling the week before Thanksgiving.

“We were like, ‘Well, I guess we should have bought more,’” Johnson laughed. “I think that’s what made us realize, ‘OK, people love what we’re doing. We should try and branch out a little.’”

When they graduated in 2021, they were faced with a dilemma: What to do about the name if they no longer needed tuition money?

“It was a pivotal moment for Trees for Tuition. You know, it was like, ‘Do we change? Do we completely change the brand?’” Johnson said. “So we decided to just start our own scholarship fund. The community helped us raise money for our college, and we wanted to kind of turn around and help kids in the community the same way they supported us.”

That same year, they launched the Trees for Tuition Scholarship and were able to help six Atlanta students by awarding them $2,000 each for higher education. Since then, they’ve awarded $36,000 to high school and college students.

“It feels amazing, honestly,” Faught said of how far they’ve come. “We get to do something that makes a ton of people happy ... They’re ready to come get in the holiday spirit, and then on top of that, we get to give out these scholarships to local students, and that just feels amazing.”"
3,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,Interest in Jimmy Carter’s Sunday school lessons continue to grow,https://www.ajc.com/news/interest-in-jimmy-carters-sunday-school-lesson-continues-to-grow/4HOCUOYXDRFRNBWL6F75LB2PGA/,"“It’s amazing how many people contact the church and ask what Sunday he’s teaching in a certain month,” said the 74-year-old Williams, who serves as the church’s clerk, secretary, piano player and member of the choir. She said even today some people don’t realize Carter, 99, who has been in home hospice since February, is no longer teaching Sunday school.

His niece, Kim Carter Fuller, teaches Sunday school class there now.

When they find out Jimmy Carter is no longer teaching, Williams said “many people burst into tears. ...They cry and weep. They said ‘We kept putting off coming here and I guess we missed out.’”

When Carter was still teaching, there were many weekends when Williams’ husband, George, could be found in the parking lot directing eager visitors. Some arrived Saturday nights and others in the wee hours of Sunday mornings to make sure they got through a Secret Service checkpoint to grab a coveted seat in the sanctuary. And if you arrived too late —which could be as early as 2 a.m. on some Sundays — you might have sit in an overflow room to hear the lesson.

For those who missed Carter teaching or want to hear it again, there are books, audiobooks and CDs of his Sunday School lessons available. Some of the lessons are on YouTube.

There are also collections of his lessons housed at the church, which Williams estimates are in the hundreds, and the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park in Plains. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta has some audiotapes of Carter teaching Sunday school.

Sarah Rix, the Plains historic site’s museum technician, said the lessons are on video, audio and some transcripts, though not currently accessible to the public.

You can order lessons from Maranatha at https://mbcplains.org/order-dvd/

So what made the lessons so popular? For one, they were taught by a former U.S. president, one known for his strong faith and public service. His lessons touched on the Bible and theological questions, but were peppered with practical thought. Many revolved around how to treat others and what you can do the make the world a better place.

Tony Lowden, the Carters’ personal pastor and a former Maranatha pastor, has another reason for their popularity:

“His messages were powerful and always challenged you to take the Word of God outside the walls of the church. He lifted people, and the lessons are part of his legacy.”

Lowden said he’d joke with Carter that people loved to come down to see JC, a private nickname he sometimes called the president. They both agreed that people should come down for the real JC — Jesus Christ.

Lines waiting to get inside the church would often extend into the church’s pecan orchard, like people were making a pilgrimage to Plains and Maranatha. “This was on a lot of people’s bucket list,” Lowden said said. Visitors included people of all political stripes and sometimes included people who weren’t Christian or hadn’t attended church in years — or ever.

In 2017, the Rev. Joseph Howard and his wife, the Rev. Bianca Howard, his in-laws and parents were able to land a front-row seat during Sunday school.

“It was amazing to be in the space,” said Howard.

Carter was very humble, approachable and comfortable, he recalled, treating every stranger like a friend. He might ask where people lived and their answers reflected the reach of his popularity: Alaska, Hawaii, Ohio, Spain and Panama. They came from all over.

He would ask the crowd if there were any pastors or missionaries in the church, their church and denomination. Then he would asked a female minister to pray, as a nod to inclusion in the pulpit.

Howard recalled the lesson was very practical, nothing overly complicated.

The lesson touched on what kind of person did those in the audience want to be. “We have a choice in how we show up in the world,” Howard recalled. “I knew this was something he lived. He was the embodiment of kindness and Christ-like character.”

Leonard Wright Jr., a native of Plains who currently lives in Summerville, S.C., attended a couple of lessons.

Wright, a former Sunday school superintendent for Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston, said Carter was very knowledgeable on Scripture.

There’s a difference, he said, between lecturing and teaching. Carter taught.

“Everything was Scripture-based and you had the opportunity for regular back and forth,” said Wright “Everybody had the opportunity to dialogue with him. It was not just him reading Scripture.”

Sitting in on one of Carter’s Sunday school lessons was also on the bucket list of Jennifer Ayres, a professor of religious education, at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology.

While attending church with the former president of the most powerful nation in the world is an attraction, people are not necessarily packing churches to hear just any government leader teach Bible study, she said.

“I think that especially when you’re talking about the education of adults, one thing that is really important is a sense of authenticity,” she said.

“People most likely wanted to be close to someone who had such a spirit of integrity. It’s such a powerful force that makes people want to come, listen and be present.”

Kim Carter Fuller, the former president’s niece, began teaching Sunday school more often after Carter fell and broke his hip in 2019, although he still came in to teach a few times after that.

Fuller, a retired English teacher, said she occasionally uses lessons that her uncle taught “but it’s a different spin on it because I can’t teach like him, obviously. He put his own spin on all of that.” Fuller said he was able to talk about places because he had visited those places when he was president and afterwards working with the Carter Center.

Fuller said her uncle knew the lessons being taught and had the information “at this fingertips.”

She’s not surprised people still come to Maranatha hoping to see her uncle.

Sometimes when they find out he’s not teaching, they turn around and leave. Others stay for the lesson.

She said he often gave her advice. Sometimes he would send her an email after her lessons. He might write, “Here’s a good example of such and such, or show me how to pronounce things because some things in the Bible are hard to pronounce. Or he might say, ‘I don’t agree with how you did that, but if that’s your take...’”

What makes Jimmy Carter a good Sunday school teacher?

“He’s passionate about the Bible and passionate about his faith,” she said. “I think he just thoroughly enjoys the studying of his faith.”"
4,[Georgia] https://www.ajc.com/news/,Atlanta baby born without kidneys spends first Christmas at home,https://www.ajc.com/news/health-news/atlanta-baby-born-without-kidneys-spends-first-christmas-at-home/KZ3R63EFWRAURDJH7FD6RZDPS4/,"Before experimental treatments during the pregnancy to help improve the baby’s odds.

Before the morning of March 24, 2021 in a delivery room when both mother and father held hands, anxiously waiting to see if their baby could take her first breath.

“I kept saying ‘Jesus’ and praying,” said Andi Mahoney.

“It was the most surreal moment of my life. I was like: ‘Am I meeting my baby or losing my baby?’”

Emilia “Emmie” Hope arrived a few weeks early, weighing 5 pounds, 7 ounces. And even before mom and dad could see baby Emmie that spring morning, they heard her: a soft cry. That meant Emmie was breathing.

Emmie was a medical marvel. But she still faced a precarious journey, an intense care plan that included a complex, daily dialysis regimen. Emmie also couldn’t live on dialysis forever. She needed a real kidney, and that meant a kidney transplant.

Credit: HYOSUB SHIN / AJC Credit: HYOSUB SHIN / AJC

These two years, nine months since her birth have also been a time of many gifts. Always a happy baby, Emmie is now a sweet, smiley toddler, a testament to tenacity, faith, science — and hope.

In July, Emmie finally received a kidney — from her mom. She is now home with her parents and older sisters, and celebrating her first Christmas without the need for a life-sustaining dialysis treatment lasting up to 14 hours.

The season has been filled with family time — baking cookies, singing carols, and participating in an Advent Bible study.

“When I look back on this journey, there are so many miracles God had to perform for Emmie to be here,” said Andi Mahoney.

Refusing to give up

The absence of one kidney is fairly common, affecting 1 in 1,000 newborns. But “bilateral renal agenesis,” where both kidneys are missing, is far more rare, occurring in only about one in every 4,000 to 7,000 pregnancies.

The condition makes survival of the infant after birth unlikely, and can cause the pregnancy itself to fail. The number of successful births is small — only about about a dozen babies in the U.S. with this condition are known to have survived.

Credit: custom Credit: custom But Andi Mahoney said she couldn’t give up. “Our thought all along was that if God takes her, then that’s it. Our palms are up. We accepted that, but we have to know we did everything in our power to try and save her,” said Mahoney. “I was like, ‘Lord, if this is not your will, shut these doors so I can’t walk through.’ And one door was always open. It was always wide open.” Kidneys are responsible for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body. They also regulate blood pressure, maintain calcium balance in the body, and play a role in the production of red blood cells. For a fetus developing without kidneys, the pregnancy is complicated by a shortage of essential amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is more than just a liquid the fetus floats in. The fluid contains nutrients, hormones, antibodies, and other essentials to keep the fetus healthy and protected. At first in a pregnancy, amniotic fluid consists of water from the mother’s body, but gradually a larger proportion comes from the baby’s developing kidneys, which add fetal urine to the amniotic fluid.

Having too little amniotic fluid can cause the baby to be born with severe abnormalities, including underdeveloped lungs. This is because amniotic fluid plays an essential role in lung development. The unborn baby “breathes” the fluid into their lungs, where it pushes open the air sacs and stimulates them to grow. Until recently, babies born without kidneys and the accompanying shortage of amniotic fluid also suffered from severely underdeveloped lungs. They quickly suffocate, unable to breathe.

Mahoney, whose family was living in Florida early in her pregnancy, learned about a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins testing how saline infusions into the womb might help babies with missing kidneys survive long enough after birth for dialysis to begin. She was not accepted into the trial but found a doctor in Florida who was willing to do the infusions.

At about a month before her due date, Mahoney went into labor. She had planned in advance to deliver at Stanford Medicine children’s hospital in California where doctors have experience delivering babies like hers.

“Our thought all along was that if God takes her, then that's it. Our palms are up. We accepted that, but we have to know we did everything in our power to try and save her."" - Andi Mahoney, Emmie's mother

The hospital system was also pioneering a special ultrafiltration device to help keep these small babies alive and growing until they were large enough to be transitioned to a more widely used type of dialysis that could be administered at home.

Credit: custo Credit: custo Until recently, there weren’t even catheters small enough to use on babies that small, let alone medical devices designed for newborns. There were many frightening moments but Emmie overcame them. At about six months of age, she was stable enough to have her care transferred to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta where she was put into a pediatric transplant program, one of the country’s leading pediatric transplant programs. The program would put the entire family on a path to not just try to keep Emmie alive, but to give her the hope of a full life with a future. The Mahoneys decided to resettle in metro Atlanta to be closer to Children’s. Dr. Rouba Garro, a nephrologist and medical director of the kidney transplant program at Children’s, received a photograph of Emmie taken by her mom as she was being loaded into an air ambulance for the trip to her new “home.” Garro was there when Emmie arrived, and was immediately struck by her personality. “She has the most beautiful smile, and even at six months of age she was able to connect with you,” said Garro. “I was thinking that I wanted to be able to provide the best care for her and see her reach her ultimate goal, which is a transplant, and do that successfully. The other thing I knew was we would have a long journey ahead of us.”

At Children’s, Emmie received care from multiple specialties: urology, pulmonology and even music therapy were needed while she waited for a transplant.

She had regular doctor appointments and many hospital stays. Most of the time, Emmie was well enough to be monitored and have dialysis at home.

By the summer of 2022, after a series of tests, it was determined Emmie’s mother was a good transplant match for Emmie and healthy enough to donate one of her kidneys.

Emmie then just needed to be big enough — at least 22 pounds — to undergo the transplant surgery. At that point, she would be the size and age children need to be in order to receive an adult-sized kidney.

When Emmie was close to 2 years of age in the fall of 2022, she was ready to receive her kidney transplant, but the surgery was rescheduled three times due to her serious health complications: First, a hernia obstruction needed emergency surgery; then severe obstructive sleep apnea; and then an infection that sent Emmie into septic shock.

“Everybody is in love”

Even when Emmie was sick in the hospital, she remained upbeat. Her family would host dance parties in her hospital room and even on difficult days, Emmie would sit up in bed, rock back and forth and tell her mom to sing the “ponytail song,” by Badnamu Pop, an animated series of songs for preschoolers.

You know I look good I got a ponytail I got a ponytail I got a p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-ponytail

“Everybody is in love with Emmie,” said Garro. “She has one of the most special personalities I have ever seen in a baby. Even when she would be in the hospital and sick and in pain, she would make sure she spread her love around, and interact in a way with you with her eyes.”

Credit: custom Credit: custom

Credit: custom Credit: custom Finally, on July 25, after nine months of delays, Emmie received one of her mom’s kidneys. The surgery went smoothly and the new kidney started working immediately, according to Garro. Garro said she’s thrilled to see Emmie off dialysis and reaching developmental milestones. From eating new foods, taking her first steps, and saying new words, Garro said “She is really happy and thriving.”

Emmie still has many challenges ahead. She gets lab work done every week and sees specialists every two weeks. Emmie maintains a feeding tube, at least for now, to help ensure proper nutrition and enough hydration which is especially important after a kidney transplant. The family and visitors must take extra precautions to protect Emmie from viruses and bugs which can be more dangerous for her immunocompromised body.

On average, a kidney from a living donor lasts 15 to 20 years, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Garro is also hopeful improvements in immunosuppressive medications required to keep a person’s body from rejecting a transplanted kidney, and care for organ recipients will help prolong the life of donated kidneys.

The hope that brought her this far can’t take a day off now.

“Emmie’s medical journey is not over,” said Garro. “She has a long road ahead. “But she is happy and growing and becoming the incredible little girl we dreamed she would be.”

Christmas, together

On a recent morning, Emmie woke up at 5 a.m. bursting with energy. She was on a mission: Where did the Elf on the Shelf fly to overnight?

Then she heads to the piano, tapping the keys, and starts singing: “Jesus loves me.”

This Christmas, the Mahoneys appreciate time together, at home — the five of them, together.

And more time to enjoy together. This will be the first Christmas morning that her parents don’t have to start getting the machine ready at about 6 p.m. and put Emmie to bed by about 7 p.m. to get started on a dialysis treatment that used to last up to 14 hours.

This Christmas, they will take nothing for granted.

“It’s been so hard, but right now it’s so beautiful,” Emmie’s mom said. “I think going through all of the hard things, gives life a depth and richness that wasn’t there before.”"
5,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Time to get real on the bullet train: California is building it, so let’s make it work",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-25/california-high-speed-rail-federal-funding-newsom-biden,"A full-scale mock-up of a high-speed train displayed at the Capitol in Sacramento.

Gov. Gavin Newsom got the Christmas present he desperately wanted from President Biden: the crucial piece of a train set.

It’s a relatively small piece that’s vital to eventually making this fancy electric train work.

I’m referring to the much-maligned bullet train that three California governors have been trying to build .

When complete, it will carry passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than three hours at speeds of up to 220 mph. That’s the sales pitch, anyway.

Advertisement

Biden’s gift is a $3.1-billion grant that’s badly needed to continue work on the high-speed rail line’s initial segment in the San Joaquin Valley.

The ambitious project has been widely lampooned over the years by many, including me, as a too-costly boondoggle and off track from the start.

But let’s get real: This giant adult toy is going to be constructed one way or another, whether at reasonable speed or in pokey chug-chug fashion . It’s time we acknowledge that and focus on making it work the best for everyone. And sooner the better.

You don’t spend $11 billion on a project, as California already has, then abandon it.

Critics consistently have asserted that bullet train money should be shifted to more essential projects — reducing homelessness, educating kids, widening freeways. But that’s practically impossible. Most bullet train money — state bonds and federal grants — can be used only for high-speed rail.

Ardent supporters just as erroneously constantly point out that California is the world’s fifth-largest economy. And if nations with smaller economies — in Europe and Asia — can afford bullet trains, they argue, California certainly can.

Wrong. Those are nations, not states. They heavily subsidize high-speed rail and can do that because their purse strings are much looser. States have budget-balancing requirements. And they can’t print money.

It would be politically impossible for California alone to finance the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco high-speed rail line that’s currently projected to cost a gargantuan $110 billion. And that estimate keeps growing. It’s now roughly three times what voters were told the line would cost when they approved a nearly $10-billion bond issue for the bullet train in 2008.

“The longer it takes to build, the more expensive it is,” says Brian Kelly, chief executive officer of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

“But it’s a lot cheaper than expanding freeways and airports.”

Could the work already done be converted to use by conventional, non-electrified passenger trains? That would be a lot less expensive.

“I suppose so,” Kelly says. “But to continue to run yesterday’s technology would not be in the state’s interest. It would be a disaster.”

The appeal of electrified trains — besides their zippy speed — is that they burn clean energy, not climate-warming fossil fuels.

But like bullet trains in Europe and Asia, California’s need generous federal funding — lots of it.

Several years ago, the feds gave California $3.5 billion for the project. That’s long gone. And it’s all the money Washington has sent — in no small part because former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield hated the bullet train because its tracks cut through his constituents’ farm fields.

But now, Biden’s Christmas present to Newsom will allow him to continue erecting the project’s first 171-mile segment from Merced to Bakersfield. The line is supposed to be operational by 2030.

“The train to nowhere,” critics long have cried.

“That’s wrong and offensive,” Newsom responded in his first State of the State Address in 2019 . “The people of the Central Valley … deserve better.”

A 2022 poll by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found wide public support for continuing to build the rail line regardless of whether it initially operates only in farm country. Among registered voters, 56% favored it, with 35% opposed.

But there was a huge partisan difference: 73% of Democrats favored construction and 66% of Republicans were opposed.

Newsom said the federal gift amounts to “a vote of confidence … and comes at a critical turning point, providing the project new momentum.”

OK, but the question still remains: Why would anyone bother to take a bullet train from Merced to Bakersfield?

Kelly answers that Amtrak already draws 1.5 million passengers annually in the valley. And high-speed rail is projected to attract 7 million.

The next links will be into the San Francisco Bay Area by 2033 — it’s promised — and later into Los Angeles and Anaheim. No one has a clue when the entire line will be complete.

The total projected cost of just the San Joaquin Valley line is up to $32 billion. That money is far from lined up.

Kelly’s goal is to get an additional $5 billion from the same kitty that provided the Christmas gift: the $1.2-trillion infrastructure package that Biden pushed through Congress and signed in 2021.

Newsom’s rail project simultaneously got a second boost from the Biden administration — indirectly, at least — when it approved a $3-billion grant for a planned bullet train between Las Vegas and Southern California.

Kelly intends to connect California’s bullet train to the Vegas line and make it easier for Central Valley residents to travel by rail to Sin City.

“This is a great opportunity for high-speed rail — to buy trains together and be more efficient,” Kelly says.

But California’s electric train remains tens of billions of dollars short of enough money for completion — with no additional dollars in sight.

Private investors haven’t shown any interest. It’s doubtful California taxpayers would dig deeper. Washington is where the money is. How does Sacramento keep tapping into its vaults?

“What they really want to see is people working,” Kelly says. “We’ve got to keep grinding, keep advancing.”

If Newsom’s a good boy, maybe Washington’s Santa will give him another piece of the train set next Christmas."

He got to go home for the holidays,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-25/immigrants-deportation-criminal-record-public-defender-counsel,"The Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center is one of the largest immigrant detention facilities in California.

The holidays can be a challenging time. It’s an especially challenging time for detainees at the Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center.

This wind-scoured private prison lurks on the western boundary of the Mojave Desert, about 10 miles from Victorville. With a built-in immigration court, it’s something of a one-stop deportation shop.

Sundays are a busy day here. The waiting room at the Desert View Annex is crowded with families. Parents. Grandparents. More children than you would expect. The visitors are nervous, if not resigned.

Opinion Opinion: No, immigration and the border are not impossible problems Instead of busing migrants and doing other stunts, why don’t politicians look to the past for policy ideas that could improve our asylum and work permit systems?

A kindly man with a Sinaloan accent makes small talk with me while we wait.

“You here to visit family?”

“No. A client.”

“Lawyer?”

“Yes, in a public defender’s office.”

“You do immigration law?”

“Not really. I’m here to fix the wrongful conviction that took away my client’s green card and got him put in deportation.”

He asks for my card. “My son has a conviction like that too. Can you talk to him?”

The staff here are pleasant, kind. A guard in a blue polo shirt exchanges the IDs of people in the waiting room for visitors’ badges. Another walks us through a series of imposing steel doors to a visiting room. Some Christmas ornaments hang from the ceiling. Clumps of plastic furniture line the periphery. A play area for children sits on the far wall. A dozen men in red and orange jumpsuits greet the arrivals.

It is palpably sad. All but one or two of these men will be deported; all but one or two of these families will be missing a son or husband or father during the holidays.

A friendly guard with perfect fake eyelashes places me in a private attorney room. I hand her a stack of papers for my client Jose. Across the reinforced glass, tears well in his eyes as he signs the documents mending the legal errors that landed him here.

Jose is in his late 50s. Been in the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident since he was 6 months old. His entire family is here. He has five adult children. Six grandchildren. Elderly parents. Owns a small business. Has no contact with his country of his birth.

In the 1990s, he pleaded guilty to possession of less than a gram of cocaine. His lawyer never asked about his immigration status, nor told him the conviction would result in him losing his green card and being placed in deportation. Not understanding the immigration consequences, he pleaded guilty. He attended some drug classes and when the judge said “case dismissed,” he thought the matter was closed. But a “dismissed” case is still a federal controlled substances conviction.

Three decades later, Jose was arrested by men in windbreakers and placed in deportation proceedings.

Last Monday, I was in court for him, and a judge signed an order vacating the conviction because it violated his 5th and 6th Amendment rights. On Tuesday, Jose’s immigration attorney filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings with the judge’s order attached. With no criminal conviction to trigger deportation grounds, Jose made it home to watch his grandkids tear into presents.

He was the luckiest man in an unlucky place. Had his conviction come from other counties in California, the public defender’s offices in those counties would very likely have refused to take his case, despite having been allocated money to do so.

In 2021, the California Board of State and Community Corrections created the Public Defense Pilot Program, which provided funds so that public defender’s offices could represent clients under several statutes, including Penal Code §1473.7. This law allows defendants to vacate criminal convictions if newly discovered evidence appears; if the conviction was obtained on the basis of race, ethnicity or national origin; or if it’s legally invalid because the person did not understand and appreciate the immigration consequences.

Although the other statutes in the pilot program also require a public defender’s office to open old cases where, almost always, mistakes of some kind will be found, many defender’s offices resist taking on cases involving immigrants because of workloads or concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

In my office in Ventura County, I was transferred from felony trials to the immigration unit to help as many eligible people as possible. Although this decision significantly increased the office’s workload, the positive results are tangible. In 2023, we prepared more than 200 §1473.7 cases on behalf of 93 immigrants like Jose.

If every public defender’s office in the state could make indigent representation under this statute a priority, we would see more justice and many more immigrants, who’ve been unfairly swept up, have an increased opportunity to make it home to their families for the holidays and in the coming year.

7,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Thinking of lighting a fire for Christmas? Not with this ban in Southern California,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-24/christmas-wood-burning-ban-southern-california,"A map of Southern California shows a large swath of pink, indicating where wood burning is prohibited on Christmas Day.

A crackling fire on Christmas Day might feel cozy, but for air quality officials in Southern California, the pollution ain’t worth it.

All wood burning, both indoor and outdoor, is banned on Monday and Tuesday for everyone living in the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Orange County and nondesert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

Manufactured fire logs, such as those made from wax or paper, also are banned while the No-Burn Day Alert is in effect.

Officials from the South Coast Air Quality Management District emphasized that these alerts are mandatory — and that they are issued when public health is at higher risk.

The particles in wood smoke — also known as fine particulate matter or PM2.5 — can bury deep into your lungs, trigger asthma attacks and cause a surge in emergency hospitalizations.

The Coachella Valley, the high desert and mountain communities above 3,000 feet in elevation are exempt from the ban, as are low-income households and homes that rely on wood as a sole source of heat.

The burn ban was originally slated to last 24 hours. On Monday, authorities extended it by a day. Register to receive email or text updates on fire restrictions at AirAlerts.org."

For this holiday season, U.S. airlines prepared for massive waves of travelers by hiring thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other workers — in an effort to avoid the delays and cancellations that marred travel in 2022, culminating with the Southwest Airlines debacle that stranded more than 2 million people.

Still, Southwest experienced hiccups again over the weekend that the airline was looking to clear by Monday. Just 2% of the airline’s flights were canceled Monday, though 16% were delayed, which is 693 flights total, according to FlightAware.

On Saturday and Sunday, Southwest canceled 426 flights and delayed 2,689 flights, FlightAware data showed.

A Southwest spokesperson blamed the issues on dense fog in Chicago on Saturday and Sunday that prevented planes from landing and said some additional cancellations may be necessary Monday ahead of what was expected to be a full recovery on Tuesday.

Auto club AAA predicted that between Saturday and New Year’s Day, 115 million people in the U.S. would travel at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) from home by air or car. That’s up 2% from last year.

Over Thanksgiving, a record number of people traveled through U.S. airports, topping pre-COVID numbers in 2019 with a single-day record of 2.9 million people screened by TSA on Sunday, Nov. 26.

Compared with the holiday season last year, more mild weather has helped keep air travel schedules on time.

But on the ground, road conditions were dangerous in parts of the country on Christmas Day, thanks to accumulating snow and ice in the Midwest and Great Plains. Most of Nebraska and South Dakota were facing blizzard conditions, and parts of eastern North and South Dakota were facing ice storms, according to the National Weather Service.

The busiest days on the road were predicted to be Saturday, Dec. 23, and next Thursday, Dec. 28, according to transportation data provider INRIX."

“I was able to get hired,” Mayfield said. “But I had an issue getting back and forth to work because I didn’t have a car.”

Advertisement

Mayfield’s warehouse job in Ennis, which paid good money, was about 30 miles from her home in Oak Cliff. She heard through word of mouth about a man named Curtis Corbins whose bus service gave people rides to work.

Advertisement

“Mr. Curtis was a ray of sunshine for me,” Mayfield said. “Rain, sleet or snow, he showed up. He made sure I was at work. He made sure we were able to get back home.”

Mayfield is one of thousands of clients who have used Corbins’ transportation service, Southern Dallas Link, since its founding in 2015. The service helps residents whose jobs are often outside public transportation routes get to work.

Advertisement

For residents in southern Dallas County without a vehicle, getting to work can often be a burden too high to overcome, a need that spurred Corbins to start his own business to help his neighbors.

After COVID hit, Corbins said some DART bus stops in southern Dallas closed down, adding to the transportation desert in the area.

“I hate seeing people struggle and suffer because of the system,” Corbins said. “It’s just a never-ending cycle for them.”

Advertisement

Many of Corbins’ clients are single moms struggling to make ends meet. Without a transportation service, Corbins said his clients would be stuck in poverty because they wouldn’t be able to get to work.

Advertisement

“Transportation seems to be one of the biggest vehicles that has helped a lot to be able to get over that hurdle,” he said.

Southern Dallas Link— which started as a one-man operation with a borrowed van — has grown into a reliable and robust fleet of buses, helping get more than 2,000 people a day to the grocery store, doctor appointments and work.

“We get started every morning at three o’clock and we go up until one o’clock in the morning,” Corbins said. “It’s just nonstop.”

Corbins’ staff also provides a shuttle service when the Dallas Regional Chamber takes tours of the southern sector to show off business opportunities in the area.

“There’s this myth that anything on the southern side is not good, but there’s a lot of good going on,” Corbins said.

During a recent tour, Corbins met Marcelo Mills, emerging markets president at American National Bank of Texas, who walked away heartbroken at the lack of investment in southern Dallas.

“If you go on this southern Dallas vision tour and you don’t leave a little bit angry and inspired, then you weren’t looking hard enough,” Mills said.

The most striking revelation for Mills was how underbanked the southern sector is, a financial desert for small business owners like Corbins who face growing demand for their services.

Southern Dallas Link recently secured a contract with DART, adding 30 buses to the service’s fleet. But the DART contract wouldn’t start paying for months, spurring Corbins to look for financing to support his business’ growth.

Mills said it was a no-brainer to connect Corbins with financial options to help cover the gap before DART paid out. Corbins had tried, — without any success, to get a loan from other banks.

Mills helped Corbins close on a $500,000 revolving line of credit to support his new contract with DART. (Kelly Morris)

“I’ve done a lot of rewarding loans in my career,” Mills said. “When you help small business owners, it’s always rewarding. But to help Mr. Corbins was extremely rewarding. I just couldn’t believe that he had had so much trouble to that point.”

Mills helped Corbins close on a $500,000 revolving line of credit to support his new contract with DART.

A revolving line of credit works just like a credit card but with a lower interest rate. Customers borrow what they need and, when they have repaid the loan, they have access to those funds once again.

“That allows us to pay our staff, our drivers, take care of fuel costs, whatever costs we incur until we start getting our monthly deposits from DART,” Corbins said. “So without that line of credit, we probably would have had to walk away from the contract because we wouldn’t have been able to sustain it until the deposits started coming in. So the timing was just perfect.”

By the end of next year, Southern Dallas Link will have a contract through DART for all its paratransit services. Corbins also hopes to soon launch an app where riders can schedule transportation like they can with Uber or Lyft.

“The need is out there,” Corbins said. “It’s just a matter of having a reliable company that can come in there and provide the services. That’s what we plan to do, is to come in here and fill those pockets and get the people in the southern sector the mobility that they need.”"

Following showers throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area Saturday evening and early Sunday, a cold front brought cooler weather conditions to the region on Christmas day.

Low temperatures in North Texas Monday evening and early Tuesday could be in the “upper 20s to the lower 30s,” the National Weather Service website showed.

The “urban heat island effect” could lead to some parts of Dallas-Fort Worth area staying above freezing overnight, said NWS Fort Worth meteorologist Eric Martello.

“All of the concrete holds in the heat from sun radiation more, so the interior of the metroplex tends to stay a few degrees warmer than the outlying suburbs and more rural areas,” Martello said, adding that cities like McKinney and Denton could see temperatures drop to the mid-to-upper 20s or low 30s.

Precipitation and significant wind chill are not expected overnight, he said.

Conditions are expected to get “a little bit warmer” throughout the day Tuesday, but a weak cold front is again expected to move through the area later that evening, Martello added. Some breezy conditions could be possible as the front moves in, he said.

“It’s basically just more dry air; it’s just going to keep the cool conditions in place,” Martello said.

Hurricane Katrina devastated parts of Louisiana in 2005, and many people fled to North Texas. Buyse’s church, Hunters Glen Baptist, became a place of shelter for evacuees. City officials in Plano found apartments for them to stay in, but evacuees left everything behind, so the church helped furnish their places.

Advertisement

Buyse had always wanted to create a permanent donation center, she said, but there was never a space at the church for one. Hunters Glen later bought a property about a half-mile away in northwest Plano and turned it into a community center known as The Hill. Buyse used part of the space to form a donation center.

Advertisement

The center, The Closet at The Hill, has become a lifeline to immigrants making North Texas their new home. The Closet helps all people in need, but many who come have arrived in their new home country with very few or no basic amenities.

About 28% of Plano residents were born outside the U.S., and a little more than half of the city’s foreign-born population are not U.S. citizens, according to 2022 U.S. Census data.

The countries they come from include Honduras, Guatemala, Russia, Ukraine and Puerto Rico, Buyse said.

Advertisement

“When they come in, they have nothing,” Buyse said. “I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve heard that. They sleep on the floor with a blanket. They may not have a pillow.”

Humble beginnings

Buyse formed the center with her friend Carolyn Parris about nine years ago, she said. The two began working out of a small L-shaped room where they kept about six to eight clothing racks. Over time, it expanded.

Advertisement

All the clothing is now housed in a sizable room upstairs with an American flag on the back wall. At the entrance, a sign reads, “Please take what you need and leave some for others.”

Advertisement

Pairs of shoes sit along a wall with their sizes labeled underneath. Clothing racks fill up the space and are divided by gender and garment. Small bins hold undergarments, purses and baby clothes.

Some racks change by season as Halloween and cold weather come and go.

“We tried to keep it just like you’re going to a department store,” said Sandi Hodnett, who oversees the clothing section.

Advertisement

Every item at The Closet — which is open every Thursday morning and the second Saturday morning each month — is donated and free, Buyse said. That includes furniture, household goods and toys.

“A lot of it comes from our congregation, but a lot of it comes from their friends,” Buyse said. “It’s truly word of mouth. Other than our church bulletin, there’s no advertising.”

On the first floor, couches, lamps, chairs and dressers sit on a gym floor. Mattresses are in a small building outside.

In a separate room, volunteers organized household items on shelves for people to grab, including towels, bedsheets, dishes and glassware. Toward the back of the first floor, dozens of toys and books are laid out on shelves.

Advertisement

The staff has expanded as well, Buyse said. Around 20 people, most of whom are retired, volunteer their time each week.

“I have ladies in their 80s, and they will sit and help people sign in and put on a name tag, so they’re greeted when they come in,” Buyse said.

‘Rewarding for us’

Each volunteer carries stories of the people they’ve helped. Hodnett recalled helping one single mother clothe her family and furnish her home.

The mom picked up a wedding dress, and her son donned his first suit.

“We were tickled about that,” Hodnett said. “He came out of the dressing room looking like he’d been given a million dollars.”

Buyse remembers one Russian woman who arrived at The Closet in December and broke down in tears. She was taken aback by the sight of all that was available to her.

“It’s so rewarding for us,” Hodnett said.

Advertisement

Some volunteers help when The Closet is closed, too. Parris spent months organizing large donations of toys, taking them home, washing them and learning how they operate — all so a child can have a gift on Christmas.

“A little girl would have a set of play dishes, or a little boy would have a set of cars and a track,” Buyse said.

Buyse’s husband, Filip, and Parris’ husband, Burland, also volunteer at The Closet, most often spending their time in the furniture section: handling pickups of donations, aiding people in picking items and occasionally doing deliveries.

“It just has grown and grown,” Burland Parris said. “We have so many people coming in needing furniture.”

Advertisement

As The Closet was coming to a close on its final operating day in December (it will be closed the final two Thursdays of the month and will reopen in January), Filip Buyse moved along hurriedly, unloading new donations, helping other volunteers and speaking to people to help find what they were looking for.

Many people who came to pick up goods spoke Spanish, underscoring the need for bilingual volunteers, like Filip Buyse. As the closet has expanded, donations are also critical to keep up with the demand. As many as 45 to 50 families sign in on the first floor to shop during operating hours, Hodnett said.

Anastasia Usataya and her 3-year-old son Daniel were among the dozens who came to pick up items Dec. 14. Usataya said she left her job as a doctor in Russia a little over a year ago when the war against Ukraine began, seeking refuge in the U.S.

When they arrived, they carried just $20 with them, she said. Usataya said she heard about The Closet from the River of Life Church, which conducts services in Hunters Glen’s church building.

“Filip and his wife, [they] make everything for us,” Usataya said. “We are grateful for them because we begin new life with this place.”"

Every year, Victor and Robin Markle eat pizza with their family — usually at Pizza Hut — as part of their holiday festivities. But this year, their son Jeremy Markle, and his wife, Joann Markle, hatched a plan to celebrate the milestone at the Forney restaurant.

The Forney couple arrived Sunday afternoon, greeted by a sign at the entrance to congratulate them on their tradition.

They were welcomed by warm hugs and the aroma of pizza baking in the oven. Family members, many of them in Christmas sweaters and matching pizza-shaped earrings, clapped as the guests of honor walked to their table.

Joann said she hoped it would be a “complete surprise” for Robin, while Victor was filled in on some details to coordinate the festivities.

Robin grew tearful as she read the letter Joann wrote to the company in October. She said she was delighted to see her family members, many of whom traveled from out of town, join the occasion.

Joann said she wrote the company expecting maybe a message or a gift card. But Pizza Hut went all in on celebrating, giving the family multiple gift cards, jackets, T-shirts and a video message from the company CEO.

”At Pizza Hut, our aim in life is to connect people through the joy of pizza,” Pizza Hut CEO Aaron Powell said in the video. “It is people like you that make things that we do worth everything.”

How a pizza tradition got its start

The Markle Pizza Hut tradition started on an uneventful Christmas Eve in 1973. It was the couple’s first year of marriage and they were in Anchorage, Alaska, where Victor was stationed in the Air Force, said Jeremy, their son.

The couple opened presents and then drove around to look at Christmas lights. During their journey, they got hungry and spotted a Pizza Hut.

The pair “scrounged up” as much money as they could find, Jeremy said, enough for a small pizza and two drinks.

Robin made sure to eat “every little crumb because it was so good,” and then told Victor, “Next year, we’re going to have more money, so we can get more pizza,” Jeremy said.

And that’s how the family became loyal Christmas Eve customers. On some occasions, the couple had to find pizza at other establishments, when they were stationed in England and Germany, Jeremy said.

On Sunday, Victor spoke about how grateful he was to God for keeping his family together throughout the years, and for allowing Robin to be with him throughout his career in the Air Force.

After more than 50 years together, they still remember how to make each other giggle.

“It’s his little boyish grin, I guess,” Robin said, as she leaned her head on Victor’s shoulder. “We made that commitment.”

The chatter around the table died down, just for a moment, as the pizzas started arriving. Robin picked off olives from her pizza and transplanted them to Victor’s slice.

“We’re able to do this because God has blessed us,” Victor said.

More pizza every year

Robin said they have invited more friends to their Christmas Eve celebration each year; and they always try to pick up the tab.

“When we didn’t have family, we always invited friends, and we said the treat’s on us. Every time we’ve invited someone, it seemed like we were doing a little bit better financially every year,” Robin said. “We didn’t always have that overseas.”

The tradition grew along with their family. Jeremy and Joann brought their children, then those grandchildren invited significant others.

The family looks for locations that haven’t lost their “restaurantlike” feel. They’ve worn matching pajamas, Santa hats and Christmas lights. Robin brings small gifts and trivia cards. Jeremy said she tells the family how “the Lord’s provided for them” so they can spend more on pizza and invite more people.

“That’s what makes it what it is,” Jeremy said. “It’s physically going there and listening to the story and just doing those little games and just all having a good time.”

It’s amusing to hear Robin, whom the family calls “Mimi,” tell the story some family members have heard their whole lives, Jeremy said.

Someone will always ask, “Hey Mimi, why do we go to Pizza Hut?”"

18,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Pregnant Colorado mom hit with stray bullet that narrowly missed daughter, 5, as family slept: ‘Babe, I just got shot’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/25/news/pregnant-colorado-mom-hit-with-stray-bullet-that-narrowly-missed-child/,"A pregnant Colorado woman was sleeping in her bed when she was struck by a stray bullet that narrowly missed her two young children.

Kendall Heinold was at home in Aurora early Thursday morning when she heard gunfire and then felt a sharp pain in her left side.

“My husband was sleeping next to me and he got up and was like, ‘Did you hear that?’ Because it was so loud, and I just looked at him and was like, ‘Babe, call 911, I just got shot,’” Heinold told KDVR.

The 27-year-old was rushed to the hospital where doctors found the bullet lodged in her shoulder.

However, because she is 16 weeks pregnant, doctors decided to leave the bullet in her rather than place her under anesthesia for surgery.

Investigators from the Aurora Police Department said the bullet may have struck Heinold after traveling hundreds of feet over a greenbelt behind her family’s home, according to KDVR.

Heinold and her husband later found a bullet hole in the house just inches away from where her children, ages 5 and 6, had been sleeping. The bullet went through the kids’ room first, she said.

“The bullet missed my 5-year-old daughter’s head by like a foot, and went through their room, through my closet and into my pregnancy pillow,” Heinold told the outlet.

She said she believes the pregnancy pillow “is what saved my life,” because it forced the bullet to change trajectory before hitting her.

Security footage from a neighbor’s home recorded at least eight gunshots that morning.

“I don’t think I was targeted, I don’t think this was intentional, but I think people need to know when a gun is shot, the bullet goes somewhere,” Heinold said.

“Luckily, it missed my children and my baby and my dog and my husband, but ended up in my arm, which I think is best case scenario, considering, but still scary.”"

The man was seen on Friday in a video obtained by FOX 5 DC being taken into custody at the fast food restaurant on Branch Avenue in Marlow Heights, Maryland.

The identity of the suspect, who was driving a stolen 2011 Hyundai Tiburon, has not been released.

Several Marlow Heights police cruisers were damaged in the collision, including one that was totaled after the man crashed into the police cruisers.

One officer was injured in the incident and was transported to the hospital, where he received treatment and was later released.

“He kept his foot on the accelerator,” Lt. Moses Edwards of the Marlow Heights Special Police told FOX 5. “We were telling him: take your foot off the accelerator, put the car in park, turn the car off. He wouldn’t. You could hear him revving up the motor, revving up the engine and during that time, [an officer] was still pinned in his vehicle.”

A woman riding in the passenger seat of the stolen vehicle told officers that the suspect also ran into a blue sedan that had a father and his 6-year-old child inside.

The two occupants of the sedan are believed to be unharmed.

“She jumped out and immediately put her hands up and said I’m not part of this,” Edwards said.

The car was stolen from outside a home in Southeast DC.

“When I got up yesterday morning and came outside to my car, there was no car,” the owner of the vehicle told FOX 5.

The owner said this was not the first time she had been carjacked and that the thief broke in and started the car without her keys.

“It’s unfortunate, but I kind of feel like people need to get jobs and work for whatever they get instead of taking whatever they can that’s materialistic, and it’s unfortunate the woman didn’t realize she was in a stolen car,” she said.

Marlow Heights Police Chief John Conklin told FOX 5 that the suspect has previous arrests, including for carjacking.

This comes as the number of car thefts in the area has soared this year.

“It’s up to the state’s attorney and the judges to prosecute and punish them for the crimes they are committing. Without the punishment, it’s going to continue,” Conklin said.

Four of the Marlow Heights police department’s eight cruisers were damaged in the incident. The four vehicles now have to be repaired or replaced."
20,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,US retaliates in Iraq after 3 US troops wounded — 1 critically — in drone attack by Iran-aligned terrorists,https://nypost.com/2023/12/25/news/us-retaliates-in-iraq-after-three-us-troops-wounded-in-drone-attack-by-iran-aligned-militants/,"President Biden ordered retaliatory airstrikes in Iraq Monday after three US soldiers were wounded — one critically — in a drone strike by Iran-backed terrorists at an American base earlier in the day, the White House confirmed.

The US military carried out the strikes around 8:45 p.m. EST, likely killing “a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants” and destroying multiple facilities used by the group, Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of US Central Command, in a statement.

“These strikes are intended to hold accountable those elements directly responsible for attacks on coalition forces in Iraq and Syria and degrade their ability to continue attacks,” Kurilla said, adding, “We will always protect our forces.”

A one-way drone strike from the militant group struck a US base in Erbil, Iraq, Monday, causing three US casualties, officials said.

The identity of the critically wounded US service member has not been released and the extent of the other’s injuries are unclear.

“My prayers are with the brave Americans who were injured,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.

Biden was “immediately” briefed on the attack and told the Pentagon to “prepare options against those responsible,” White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

After mulling his options, Biden called Austin and ordered the air strike.

Additional details on the operation were not immediately available.

“The President places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm’s way. The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue,” Watson said.

US bases and assets in the Middle East have come under attack by Iran-aligned militias in recent weeks over Washington’s support for Israel in its fight against Hamas in Gaza since war erupted in October.

Angus Bain, 17, endured seizure attacks at least once a week for most of his life, but doctors are optimistic he’ll be free of the debilitating condition after he became one of the first patients in the UK to have the new laser surgery, SWNS reported.

The trailblazing surgery removes the brain tissue that causes seizures. Ten weeks later, Angus has not had a single incident.

“Our lives have been consumed with Angus’s epilepsy since he was 5,” his mother, Nicki Bain, of Gateside, Fife, told the outlet.

“He has been on lots of very heavy medication, had wires in his head, brain stimulation, so many tests and scans.”

“I can’t even put into words what it means to him, and all our family, for him to be seizure-free for Christmas this year,” she said.

Angus received the procedure at the Edinburgh Children’s Hospital in October. The innovative laser technology — known as MRI-guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) — is minimally invasive and the surgery takes just under two hours with a relatively short recovery time, according to SWNS.

“The laser surgery is a fantastic development for specific patients and will give some with epilepsy a real chance to live a normal life,” Dr. Jothy Kandasamy, consultant neurosurgeon at the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, told the outlet.

“The surgery has been life-changing not just for Angus, but for the entire family,” he added.

The teen is just the second young person in Scotland to get the surgery.

Roslyn Neely, CEO of Edinburgh Children’s Hospital Charity, said she was “encouraged by the life-changing impact that the laser surgery has had for Angus.”

Nicki Bain said her son’s “future is looking so bright, and we’re incredibly proud and excited for him.”

The teen said he hopes to one day get his driver’s license, play rugby or go skiing, things that had been too risky for him to do pre-surgery.

“I wish I could go to parties with my friends. I see photos of all my friends together and I am jealous that I can’t go but they can,” he wistfully told BBC Scotland News.

While checking those things off his list may take some time as he continues to recover, Angus is thrilled with the outcome so far.

“I’ve never had such a long period not having a seizure, it’s an amazing relief. I’m so happy.”"

Barstow firefighters were called to the scene just before 7 p.m. Dec. 14 after receiving multiple reports of a house fire with children stuck inside, the department said in a social media post.

Charmon and Akeem Isom told FOX 11 Los Angeles they did all they could to try to save their family before firefighters arrived, but Aalijah Isom, 2, and Annie Isom, 7, were trapped.

“You run, and you try to do as much as you can,” Charmon Isom said. “Bust windows, run in, try and get in, try and get under the fire. I have (first-degree) burns on my feet from trying to get in there.”

Firefighters had to jump through two separate bedroom windows to locate the girls.

They were handed off to police officers who rushed them to ambulances, Barstow Fire Protection District said.

The girls were rushed to a local hospital.

Family says they first lost Aalijah. Annie was airlifted to a burn center where she was put on life support, but died after a week-long battle when her parents decided to let her go.

The 7-year-old’s organs were donated following her death.

A vigil was held for the girls Saturday, where their father said, “There’s no amount of money, there’s no amount of valuables that can bring back my children.”

The family is now raising money to pay for the girls’ funerals and to help the rest of the family find a new home. It is believed the smoke detectors did not work in the home they lost.

The Los Angeles Fire Department has a website dedicated to the dangers Christmas trees can pose inside homes, as well as safety tips.

The vehicle lost control, hit a pole and rolled over before landing in a water-filled ditch on the southbound side of Interstate 95 in Ormond Beach around 11:45 a.m., according to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office.

Good Samaritans stopped and helped get the woman and her three children — the oldest of which was just 5 years old — from the car when deputies and firefighters from Ormond Beach arrived.

Fortunately, the four only suffered minor injuries — however, their Christmas gifts were still in the car, which sat in 3 feet of water.

As the woman and children were taken to an area hospital, firefighters used a ladder to reach the vehicle and were able to salvage most of the gifts.

They formed a human chain with deputies and moved the presents to dry land.

“Because of these efforts, deputies were able to transport the gifts to the VSO office, where they were sorted, dried, supplemented with a few extra donated gifts, and then brought to the hospital for the children,” the sheriff’s office said in a press release.

The sheriff’s office thanked all those who assisted in making the victims’ Christmas “a little bit brighter despite the crash.”"

President Alexander Lukashenko said at a meeting of a Moscow-led economic bloc in St. Petersburg that the shipments were completed in October, but he did not give details of how many weapons were sent or where they have been deployed.

Tactical nuclear weapons, which are intended for use on the battlefield, have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles.

Russia said it would maintain control over those it sends to Belarus.

Lukashenko has said that hosting Russian nuclear weapons in his country is meant to deter aggression by Poland, a NATO member.

Ocala police said Albert J. Shell Jr. 39, gunned down David Nathaniel Barron, 40, at Paddock Mall Saturday in what they believe was a targeted hit.

Officials also released surveillance footage of a second man who may have “tampered with crucial evidence by taking the shooter’s red hat” after the violence sent shoppers scampering for safety.

“That hat may contain valuable DNA evidence,” the department said, asking for the public’s help in naming the unidentified man.

A prior mugshot of Shell — who is now wanted for first-degree murder and remains on the run — shows him with a cross tattooed on his forehead and a teardrop under one eye.

Authorities said the shooter struck Barron multiple times during the pre-Christmas chaos around 3:40 p.m. — including in the head.

A woman was struck in the leg and is expected to survive, according to WESH.

Cops said Shell managed to flee the mall and remains at large.

He discarded the gun used in the murder, and it was later recovered by police.

Cops locked the packed mall down for 12 hours while unsuccessfully searching for the killer.

Ocala police are offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to Shell’s arrest.

Josh Pawchi, who hunkered down inside a Kay Jewelers with his parents, posted a video to Facebook showing his step-dad telling someone on a cellphone that two people were “shooting at each other” outside the mall’s Chick-fil-A.

“He chased him and just kept shooting at him,” he could be heard saying in the footage. “They were going after each other.”

A local journalist who was volunteering at the mall roughly one hour from Orlando said she saw the killer mere feet away from her.

“I was volunteering at the wrapping station that raises money for the domestic violence shelter, and the gunman was probably about 10 feet away,” witness Jennifer Hunt Murty said.

“We didn’t really have any protection other than tables with linens over them but we went to the floor, and everybody else was running, so we were very close to the shooting as it occurred, and had very little protection to hide.”

Barron was a tattoo artist and father who lived with his 17-year-old son, the boy’s mother told WESH.

“He won’t have his daddy there to celebrate his 18th birthday … he’s graduating next year. He was living with his father at this time … so it’s a big blow for him,” Cheatara Taylor said.

The mother of Barron’s eldest daughter called Shell “the Grinch. He took Christmas away from my baby and all his kids,” La Evans told the station."

FOX 24 in Rogers, Arkansas reported that court documents say a woman called the Bella Vista Police Department on Dec. 9 to say 52-year-old Lawrence Hickman was harassing her.

When officers arrived at Hickman’s residence, they met with the woman who said she had found a bottle of chloroform in a dresser drawer.

She also allegedly told police there were pipe bombs in a plastic bag in Hickman’s home on Bishampton Lane.

After X-raying the bombs, the affidavit noted, the bombs were found to be live.

Neighbors were reportedly evacuated from their residences after the Bentonville Bomb Squad was contacted about the situation.

Hickman, police said, was not at the home and the woman said she was not sure where he was.

One neighbor who officers spoke with said Hickman aspired to kayak to the Philippines, where his wife is, and plans to travel to Alaska and through the Bering Sea.

The neighbor also allegedly said the pipe bombs were for sharks and pirates, while he also possessed booze for Russians, the station reported court documents as noting.

On Dec. 13, police apprehended Hickman at a pier with two inflatable kayaks in Pacific County, Washington.

In recordings of the phone call, obtained by The Post, the man accused the troubled Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the Near East, known as UNRWA, of being under Hamas’ power, telling an IDF officer that the terrorist group has been hogging all the supplies.

“The situation is terrible because the humanitarian people, those responsible for the humanitarian aid, are thieves,” the frustrated Gaza resident said in the recording.

“Hamas has their hands on UNRWA administration workers, and it manages UNRWA,” he alleges. “From the day they [Hamas] rose to power they took control of everything.”

The man also claimed that Hamas has made sure the incoming humanitarian supplies were distributed to its own people first as opposed to the more than one million civilians who have been displaced by the war.

An IDF official told The Post the call between the soldier and civilian was recorded when the officer was making his rounds to inform Palestinians of where to evacuate to and seek aid supplies as Israel continues its bombardments in Gaza.

The allegations, which reveal the civilian’s frustration over the lack of aid arriving in Gaza amid the war, was just the latest in a troubling series of discoveries made by the Israeli forces during its offensive, including the presence of UNRWA-labeled bags carried by Hamas operatives, the IDF official said.

UNRWA did not respond to The Post’s request for comment Sunday.

The group’s stated mission is to “provide assistance and protection for registered Palestine refugees.”

It has previously faced allegations of providing support to the terrorist group

UNRWA, officially dedicated to humanitarian aid, has long faced criticism for allegedly providing support to the terrorist group.

The IDF has said it has found Hamas tunnels near UNRWA schools.

UNRWA has repeatedly denied the allegations that they are affiliated with the terror group.

The US House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to launch an investigation into UNRWA, according to three members of the committee.

“There is extensive evidence of a troubling connection between UNRWA and Hamas, and it is far deeper than was known,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), a senior member of the committee. “Congress must now investigate and uncover the extent of what UNRWA knew, what it did, and what it may be hiding from the world.”

While the US halted aid to the UNRWA under the Trump administration in 2018, President Biden renewed the funding in 2021, rolling out $153 million in aid.

The US has provided at least $730 million since Biden took office.

The IDF said it would be more than happy to cooperate with any US investigation into the UNRWA."
28,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Golf cart wrecks and fires rampant across Florida: ‘Housewives getting drunk and crashing’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/25/news/golf-cart-crashes-and-fires-rampant-across-florida-due-to-unruly-people/,"For Fore!… to Fire!

Florida public safety officials say unruly kids, intoxicated housewives and non-safety conscious people are to blame for an alarming rise in golf cart fires, explosions and serious crashes in the state.

Once limited to puttering across the links, electric vehicles are now everywhere in bustling Sunshine State communities, which tout themselves as “golf cart friendly.”

But, emergency service officials told The Post, that has led to a sharp spike in golf cart related mayhem — from garage explosions to booze-fueled accidents with severe injuries.

“We see it all now,” said one veteran emergency worker in The Villages, about an hour North west of Florida.

“You have housewives getting drunk at lunch and getting into their carts and crashing.

“You have kids doing donuts and flipping over. Carts catching fire sometimes. Most people are responsible. But a hell of a lot of people aren’t.”

Jacksonville Fire Department Captain Eric Prosswimmer said he’s seen a marked rise in golf cart fires of late, where batteries overheat and ignite due to substandard components or overcharging.

With many owners juicing up their vehicles inside their garage or in their driveways, entire homes have gone up in flames within minutes.

An 18-year-old Martin County boy suffered burns in November after his family’s cart suddenly caught fire in their garage and engulfed their home.

The teen suffered the injuries after unsuccessfully trying to save his dog from the blaze. He later made a full recovery after several days on a ventilator.

A 3-year-old child and her mother were badly injured and two others hospitalized in North Lauderdale earlier this month after their house caught fire in the middle of the night.

Local officials believe the fire sparked from a golf cart that was charging on their property.

4 Officials said they are seeing a sharp hike in golf cart fires. News4Jax

In The Villages, three golf carts have suddenly burst into flames on the street in recent months — with one inferno erupting during a crowded outdoor festival.

“They are becoming more prevalent now simply because they are more prevalent on the market,” Prosswimmer said.

Many of the fires stem from owners looking to cut costs by using foreign made and lightly regulated chargers or other components, he noted.

With the niche becoming increasingly lucrative and competitive, Prosswimmer said some sellers are lowering their overhead by using cut rate parts.

“In a controlled environment they are fine,” he said. “But anytime there is an explosion in demand you are going to have some unscrupulous people. Moving forward, it’s going to become more of a problem.”

Serious golf cart accidents, one Florida attorney told The Post, are becoming near epidemic.

Lawyer Frank Butler, who specializes in golf cart cases, said the vehicles are becoming integrated into commercial areas and mingling with regular vehicle traffic.

That mix, he said, has kept his office phones chiming.

“A lot of little towns are passing laws to make their downtowns golf cart accessible,” he said. “I don’t think the risks are fully appreciated. We’re seeing an increase in accidents and crashes across the board.”

Butler said many owners view their cart as a “carefree” mode of transport, often not bothering to buckle up or drive with caution.

4 Most people charge their golf carts in their garage, which puts their homes at risk in case of fire. News4Jax

Injuries, he said, are often serious because of the near total lack of protection in the event of a crash.

From devastating orthopedic damage to death, he’s seen the gamut.

The veteran emergency responder from The Villages reported that many golf cart incidents involve alcohol.

Drivers view the odds of encountering law enforcement while doing 20 miles per hour down a golf cart path slim, and thus take liberties with libations.

Luis Garcia Villagran, a self-proclaimed Evangelical Christian who hails from Mexico, was at the forefront of a mass migration once again this week, bringing an estimated 8,000 migrants on a Christmas Eve march through Mexico to a US border already in crisis — and predicting the number of asylum-seekers could easily nearly double to 15,000 along the way.

“We try to help people least protected, especially women and child migrants,” the media-savvy frontman told The Daily Caller in a July 2022 interview. “Simply, we apply what is in the law.”

Villagran, who heads the Center for Human Dignity, boasted at the time that he had guided 40,000 migrants to the border since September 2021 — a figure that has multiplied since then and is expected to swell even more in the coming weeks and months.

The organizer told the outlet that he is not financed or assisted by external organizations — and is motivated by his faith and a belief in the right of migrants to exit their impoverished origins.

Villagran was previously arrested in the Mexican state of Chiapas in 1997 on kidnapping and conspiracy charges, allegations he denied. He was convicted by a judge and sentenced to 40 years behind bars, but working with several human rights groups, he appealed his case and was eventually freed in 2010.

The activist, who runs his group with his wife, Martha Martinez de la Fuente, said he was tortured while in custody — and that those prior struggles also fuel his mission.

The activist said he was “stigmatized as dangerous, and they took me to maximum security prisons until the [Inter-American Commission on Human Rights] demanded my freedom.”

Villagran suffered a detached retina while in solitary confinement and contends that the condition was left untreated, leading to the loss of sight in one eye.

“The damage was repaired, and that is where the Center for Human Dignity was born,” he said.

A 2021 profile in Mexico Daily described Villagran and fellow organizer Irineo Mujica as media savvy tacticians who attempt to manage perceptions of the migrant movement in addition to the thousands in their charge.

“García is more pastor than protester: pensive, eloquent, cool-headed,” the outlet wrote. “Both understand the power of public opinion, and have a knack for politics and an eye for the camera.”

As for his caravan this Christmas season, “Today we are the poorest of the poorest of those who are at the peak of need, those of us who do not have money to pay for visas or polleros,” said Villagrán, referring to human smugglers.

Villagran has vocally criticized American immigration policy in the past, calling it “domineering” and driven by a desire to “impose.”

There have been roughly 2 million migrant encounters at the US southern border in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

Nearly a quarter million migrants crossed the perimeter in November alone — a new high for the month and the third highest total in history.

“We won’t be stopped, we’ll keep walking,” Villagran vowed over the weekend, according to a Reuters report."
30,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Holiday travelers get a Christmas gift of normalcy — except for Southwest fliers marred by delays,https://nypost.com/2023/12/25/news/holiday-travelers-get-a-christmas-gift-of-normalcy-except-for-southwest-fliers-marred-by-delays/,"Conditions were mostly nice this year for travelers flying ahead of and on Christmas, but some naughty disruptions again plagued those flying with Southwest Airlines.

For millions of people traveling over the holiday, this year was much better than last. Christmas morning put a bow on a relatively smooth weekend.

By midday Monday, only 138 flights within, into or out of the U.S. had been canceled and 1,366 were delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware.

For this holiday season, U.S. airlines prepared for massive waves of travelers by hiring thousands of pilots, flight attendants and other workers — in an effort to avoid the delays and cancellations that marred travel in 2022, culminating with the Southwest Airlines debacle that stranded more than 2 million people.

Still, Southwest experienced hiccups again over the weekend that the airline was looking to clear by Monday. Just 2% of the airline’s flights were canceled Monday, though 12% were delayed, which is 524 flights total, according to FlightAware.

On Saturday and Sunday, Southwest canceled 426 flights and delayed 2,689 flights, FlightAware data showed.

A Southwest spokesperson blamed the issues on dense fog in Chicago on Saturday and Sunday that prevented planes from landing and said some additional cancellations may be necessary Monday ahead of what was expected to be a full recovery on Tuesday.

Auto club AAA predicted that between Saturday and New Year’s Day, 115 million people in the U.S. would travel at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) from home by air or car. That’s up 2% from last year.

More than 2.6 million people were screened by the Transportation Security Administration on Thursday, according to TSA records. Data from the weekend is yet to be released.

Over Thanksgiving, a record number of people traveled through U.S. airports, topping pre-COVID numbers in 2019 with a single-day record of 2.9 million people screened by TSA on Sunday, Nov. 26.

Compared with the holiday season last year, more mild weather has helped keep air travel schedules on time.

But on the ground, road conditions were dangerous in parts of the country on Christmas Day, thanks to accumulating snow and ice in the Midwest and Great Plains. Most of Nebraska and South Dakota were facing blizzard conditions, and parts of eastern North and South Dakota were facing ice storms, according to the National Weather Service.

The busiest days on the road were predicted to be Saturday, Dec. 23, and next Thursday, Dec. 28, according to transportation data provider INRIX."

If you asked 103-year-old Angelina “Angie” Torrisi and 101-year-old Margaret Vaccaro, they would not tell you they surpassed 100 years of age because of their jobs, the things they owned or the money they had in their bank accounts.

Both women told FOX Business that it has a lot to do with getting rid of the stress in life, and simply being kind. It is a lesson they believe younger generations should learn.

The women are Northwell Health patients and were recently featured in a Northwell Health ad, where they discussed their New Year’s resolutions and what it means to be healthy at an advanced age.

“I’ll have to tell them they have to be in a good frame of mind, and they have to be very kind, compassionate and be grateful for what they have and just be a… good person,” Torrisi told FOX Business when asked what advice she would give younger generations.

Torrisi’s niece, Julia, added that when her aunt was 60 years old, she helped raise her three grandchildren after her son gained full custody of his kids.

If you are kind, it will “always come back to you,” Torrisi said.

Torrisi also said people should try “not to sweat the little gritty stuff of life.”

“I think people put so much stress on themselves. They worry about things that are not important to them… you have to avoid the stress,” she said.

To keep stress down, she said it is important to keep busy.

“If you sit around [and] do nothing, stupid thoughts will go through your mind. You have to keep busy doing other things,” she said. For Torrisi, she turns to cooking – and eating.

“I bake. I eat,” she said with a laugh.

Torrisi also credits her long and healthy life to being active when she was younger, which included rolling skating and basketball. She also recalled walking up five flights of stairs to her home every day.

“We didn’t have elevators. We didn’t use transportation. We walked to school. We walked to the church. I lived on the top floor. We walked up five flights of stairs,” she said.

Vaccaro – known for being active in her community – also highlighted the importance of keeping busy and helping others.

“What I think keeps you healthy is to just stay involved,” she told FOX Business. “What I’m doing right now is what I have done for many years, and that is to make a difference wherever I may be.”

Vaccaro has volunteered at her New York-based independent living facility for many years. She prepares the welcome packet of information for new tenants and organizes the facility’s holiday bonus fund for employees, raising more than $12,000 annually to distribute to employees. She was also the chair of the facility’s resident council where she organized the election of council members.

Vaccaro believes everyone is blessed with different abilities and talents and “that we are called upon to use those for the good of others.”

Her advice to younger generations is to look around at what differences you can make.

“That is critical,” she said.

Although Vaccaro knows it’s impossible to live a completely stress-free life, she said that younger generations also need to stop with the “woulda, coulda, shoulda at night.”

“Go to sleep and wake up looking forward to what you can do this day… with the beauty of the world all around us.”"

During his latest visit near the frontlines of the war, Netanyahu touted the Israeli army’s successes in Gaza, where Israel’s troops have decimated nearly all of the Hamas terrorists’ northern battalions.

In video uploaded by the prime minister’s office, Netanyahu is seen arriving in Gaza in a helicopter and being driven to where the troops were stationed.

He was seen shaking hands and speaking with the soldiers, assuring them that the military will work to keep them safe and reiterating that the war will not come to an end until Hamas is eradicated.

“First thing — we will do everything to keep you safe,” Netanyahu said. “Secondly, we are not stopping. Anyone who talks about stopping — no.

“We’re not stopping. This war is going to go until the end. Until we finish them. No less than that,” he added.

“The nation of Israel is proud of its heroic warriors. I’m proud of you,” Netanyahu concluded.

The prime minister’s office added that Netanyahu thanked the soldiers for serving their nation and being away from their families for more than two months now, describing their dedication and sacrifice as the “key to victory.”

Along with speaking with the troops, Netanyahu was also brief on the types of weapons and tunnel shafts the IDF has found sprawled throughout civilian infrastructures in Gaza.

Over the weekend, the IDF released disturbing images of some of these finds, including explosive belts adapted for children and toy chests hiding warheads at a Gaza kindergarten.

The explosive belts fitted for kids were found inside a Hamas compound tucked near schools, a mosque and a medical facility, the IDF noted.

Another raid at a Gaza school that was serving as a shelter for Palestinian refugees also turned up rows and rows of grenades, RPG missiles, explosives and firearm ammunition."
33,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,‘Zombie deer disease’ concerns scientists over possible spread to humans,https://nypost.com/2023/12/25/news/zombie-deer-disease-concerns-scientists-over-possible-spread-to-humans/,"The discovery of Yellowstone National Park’s first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) last month has raised concerns that the fatal brain disease may someday spread to humans, according to some scientists.

A deer carcass in the Wyoming area of the park tested positive for the highly contagious prion disease that can also cause weight loss, stumbling, listlessness and neurological symptoms, according to the CDC.

It has been spotted in deer, elk, reindeer and moose in areas of North America, Canada, Norway and South Korea.

Symptoms can take up to a year to develop and some have dubbed it the “zombie deer disease” since it changes in the hosts’ brains and nervous systems, leaving animals drooling, lethargic, emaciated, stumbling and with a telltale “blank stare,” according to the Guardian.

It is fatal, with no known treatments or vaccines.

And now scientists are sounding the alarm that it could infect humans, although no known case has ever been recorded.

Epidemiologists say the absence of a “spillover” case yet does not mean it will not happen.

CWD is one of a cluster of fatal neurological disorders that includes Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly referred to as “mad cow disease.”

“The BSE outbreak in Britain provided an example of how, overnight, things can get crazy when a spillover event happens from, say, livestock to people,” Dr. Cory Anderson told The Guardian. Anderson is a program co-director at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP).

“We’re talking about the potential of something similar occurring. No one is saying that it’s definitely going to happen, but it’s important for people to be prepared,” Anderson added.

He added that what’s also worrying is that there is no known way to effectively and easily eradicate it, “neither from the animals it infects nor the environment it contaminates.”

Anderson said that once an environment is infected, the pathogen is extremely hard to eradicate. It can persist for years in dirt or on surfaces, and scientists report it is resistant to disinfectants, formaldehyde, radiation and incineration at 1,100 F, according to The Guardian.

The CDC on its website says that some animal studies suggest CWD poses a risk to certain types of non-human primates, like monkeys, that eat meat from CWD-infected animals or come in contact with brain or body fluids from infected deer or elk.

“These studies raise concerns that there may also be a risk to people,” the CDC website reads. “Since 1997, the World Health Organization has recommended that it is important to keep the agents of all known prion diseases from entering the human food chain.”

“The BSE outbreak in Britain provided an example of how, overnight, things can get crazy when a spillover event happens from, say, livestock to people,” Dr. Cory Anderson told the Guardian. REUTERS

Parks officials said that since the mid-1980s, the fatal brain disease has spread across Wyoming and is now found in most of the state. The disease is estimated to be found in 10-15% of the mule deer near Cody that migrate to the southeastern section of Yellowstone in the summer. Yellowstone National Park said last month that the long-term effect of the disease on deer, elk and moose in Yellowstone is uncertain.

The Alliance for Public Wildlife, according to the Guardian, estimated in 2017 that 7,000 to 15,000 CWD-infected animals a year were unwittingly being eaten by humans, and that the number was expected to increase by 20% annually.

In 2005, researchers started observing 80 people who mistakenly ate the infected meat and found that the group had “no significant changes in health conditions,” according to USA Today.

Still, with the hunting season underway, the CDC recommends that hunters “strongly consider having those animals tested before eating the meat.” The agency also advises hunters harvesting wild deer and elk from areas with reported CWD to check state wildlife and public health guidance to see whether testing of animals is recommended or required in a given state or region.

Meanwhile, Yellowstone staff have increased collaboration and information sharing with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and other state agencies to identify areas within Yellowstone with increased risk for CWD. Monitoring for the presence of CWD in deer, elk and moose in the park has also been ramped up as has testing from carcasses."

The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, which acts as the city’s planning agency within the tourism district, recently approved two planned dispensaries, including the one by the convent, a business that would take the place of a former dry cleaner.

Members of the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal Convent on Mississippi Avenue in the gambling mecca had argued that they host classes — including some for teenagers — and sobriety meetings at their location and therefore should not have a dispensary so close.

They added to the CRDA that they were concerned about crime escalating in the area as a result of a new dispensary, too.

“I’m actually Dutch, so I grew up in a country where marijuana was legalized, and I’ve seen a lot of things over the years,” Sister Joseph Van Munster said at a November hearing, according to a transcript obtained by the Press of Atlantic City.

She said there were already problems in the neighborhood with illicit drug and alcohol use and argued that a new dispensary could be harmful for those dealing with substance abuse issues and working toward recovery.

But the CRDA approved the application for the proposed new dispensary near the convent. New Jersey law does not prohibit cannabis dispensaries from opening near such sites as it does with schools.

Neither the convent nor CRDA responded to Post requests for comment Monday.

The approval of the pot dispensary near the convent was the second time the board has OK’d such a business in Atlantic City despite concerns from church officials, according to the Press.

Over the summer, members of the Chelsea Baptist Church spoke out against a planned cannabis business about a block away — but that, too, wound up being approved by the board.

“They don’t want them anywhere near the casinos, but they don’t care where else they go,” Pastor Tom Weer told the Press in September.

He claimed the board simply told church members to install video cameras or hire a tow truck company to keep unwanted vehicles off their lot when they expressed concerns about people smoking weed near their place of worship or committing crimes.

Members of the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal expressed concerns about crime escalating in the area as a result of the new dispensary, which would take over an old laundromat.

“It seemed to me at the meeting they were all gung ho,” Weer said of board supporters of the move. “As far as we know, if it’s there, we just have to put up with it.”

The CRDA rarely disapproves applications for new cannabis businesses in Atlantic City, which has already approved applications for indoor weed farms, a woman-owned dispensary inside a former church and Amsterdam-style cannabis lounges.

Mayor Marty Small Sr.’s administration sees these new businesses as a powerful economic engine, potentially bringing in new jobs and new investment into the city.

“My focus is to make Atlantic City great, to make Atlantic City the East Coast hub for cannabis,” Kashawn “Kash” McKinley, the city’s cannabis czar, told Delaware Online.

Per capita, the cannabis businesses that had already received approval as of April would make Atlantic City the densest cannabis city in the state, according to the outlet."

The event, Vision Australia’s Carols by Candlelight, had 10,000 people in attendance and was broadcast live on Channel 9 as the crowd booed.

The protesters raised Palestinian flags as they trampled across the stage and screamed about Gaza before they were dragged away by security.

“Well, it is the climate, isn’t it?” a female host said.

“It’s OK, everybody, we are actually fine here. … Everyone’s allowed to have their … moment. … It’s a very hard time in this world … There’s a lot of pain out there that people are experiencing,” another host said.

Israel has been at war ever since fighters from the Palestinian Hamas terrorist group crossed into the country from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 and killed some 1,200 Israelis.

Some social media users on X had a different reaction.

Darren Grimes, a conservative commentator at GB News, said, “No. This moment isn’t theirs.”

“This behavior will not ‘Free Palestine,’ it’s just shameful,” pro-Israel activist Hen Mazzig said.

“Carols by Candlelight is the largest annual fundraiser for Vision Australia’s children’s services, with all proceeds from the event supporting services for families and children who are blind or low vision,” the program’s description said.

“Your donations directly contribute to Vision Australia’s children services and Life Ready Program. This program is designed to encourage and support childhood development and the education of children and young people who are blind or have low vision, like Lucy, so they can form strong foundations for life, true meaningful participation and lifelong employment,” the Vision Australia website said.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have also caused disruptions across the United States.

On Christmas morning Monday, Father Edward Beck was asked about the “pain and suffering” taking place all over the world during the holiday season and to address those who are feeling “hopeless.”

“I think the message of Christmas is that God enters into it with us and we’re not alone in it,” Beck responded. “What I’m so struck by is that the story of Christmas is about a Palestinian Jew- how often do you find those words put together? A Palestinian Jew born into a time when his country was occupied, right? They can’t find a place for her to even give birth, his mother. They’re homeless. They eventually have to flee as refugees into Egypt, no less. I mean, you can’t make up the parallels to our current world situation right now.”

He continued, “And so in some way, that is who we believe God becomes born into that situation and yet, that very man, Jesus, says love one another, love your enemies. There is hope. There is light in the darkness. I’m attesting to that. So somehow that God enters that experience of suffering and that struggle and is actually born into it. That is what is so miraculous about this celebration for me.”

Critics railed against the CNN guest on social media, blasting his “incorrect” history of Jesus Christ.

“This is embarrassingly wrong,” New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz reacted.

“Because you know how in Matthew 15:24 Jesus said ‘I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,’ by Israel Jesus meant Palestine. Father Beck has to stop watching Al-Jazeera and start reading the New Testament,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies research fellow Hussain Abdul-Hussain swiped the Roman Catholic priest.

“How can the press signal itself not really connected to the people? Put on commentary like this” conservative radio host Erick Erickson said. “Palestine was not even a creation of the Roman Empire at the time of Christ’s birth. Pushing a political agenda like this, using Christ, reflects poorly on the network.”

“The war on Christmas is even more pernicious this year courtesy of CNN,” GOP strategist Steve Guest wrote.

“Merry Christmas from CNN,” Versus Media Podcast host Stephen L. Miller quipped.

Beck defended his stance on X, sharing a Britannica article called “Jewish Palestine at the time of Jesus” and sharing a quote from another link that read “remembering that the name ‘Palestinian’ has long referred to Muslims, Jews, and others who have lived in that part of the world for generations.”

But that did not quell the uproar over his comments.

“We all heard you on CNN today, claiming that Jesus was a Palestinian Jew, and comparing his plight with Palestinians today being forced to ‘flee into Egypt.’ Shame on you for inciting hate reminiscent of blood libels,” Samwawal Foundations founder Avi Kaner said to Beck.

Beck replied, “Sorry you heard what you wanted to hear. But my message was one of unity and solidarity—with both Israel, and with suffering Palestinians. The more we accentuate our differences, the less love there will be in the world.”"

Houston firefighters said they received a call about a fire at the star’s former home on Rosedale Street in the city’s Third Ward just after 2 a.m.

When crews arrived just about three minutes later, they saw the second-story of the three story home was already engulfed in flames, ABC 13 reports.

Photos and videos from the scene show flames bursting out of the windows as firefighters entered the smoke-filled premises and the family who lived there watched in shock.

Crews even had to cut into the roof of the home to clear out the attic before they were able to get the fire under control, according to Click 2 Houston.

“They did a great job,” Fire District Chief Justin Barnes told ABC 13. “I’m going to say, in less than 10 minutes, we had a really good grip on this fire.”

No injuries were reported, and the family — a couple and their two young children who were still in their Christmas pajamas — evacuated the home before firefighters arrived.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Beyoncé’s parents had bought the home for $64,000 in 1981 — the same year the iconic musician was born, but they moved out just a few years later, before Solange Knowles was born in 1986, according to TMZ.

Highway patrol received reports of a reckless driver speeding through Miami Gardens traffic on the night of Nov. 29 and dispatched Trooper Walner Wroy to the area, according to Local 10.

Wroy eventually located the vehicle on the freeway — a Kia Stinger — and turned on his lights.

But the vehicle didn’t slow down or pull over, continuing to blast through red lights after taking an exit.

Dash cam footage shows Wroy eventually making contact with the car’s rear, forcing it to spin out and stop directly ahead of him, face to face.

But the halted driver — who turned out to be Opa-locka police captain Cory Krotenberg — then activated flashing blue and red lights to identify him as law enforcement.

He then gets out of the car and raises hands in disbelief.

‘You f—— kidding me?” Krotenberg tells the stunned trooper.

“Oh, I got the wrong car,” he says. “I didn’t see the light in the back.”

After a probe, officials said last week that Krotenberg was part of a multi-agency anti-gang operation and was pursuing a suspect believed to have taken part in a violent crime,

Krotenberg also had a helicopter flying overhead to help him track the suspect.

“It was a blacked out car,” he tells Wroy. “I was right on his a–!”

“Oh my God,” the trooper says in response.

Wroy, officials said, was not disciplined because he had reasonable grounds to mistake the fleeing car for a civilian.

“The Trooper had a well-founded and reasonable belief that a violator was fleeing and eluding a lawful order to stop, and the Trooper performed his duties with professionalism and precision,” FHP Executive Director Dave Kerner told the outlet. “Police work is a challenging profession, and State Troopers are trained and trusted to make difficult decisions under the most challenging of circumstances.”

Krotenberg’s agency told Local 10 that he did not violate any policies either during the pursuit."

Dear Readers: As I offer my 20th annual year-end “charity roundup,” I’d like to remind readers that while charity truly does begin at home, it need not stay there. Those who can afford to share their material wealth should give abundantly, donating locally to the local library, after-school program, hospice center, arts organizations, historical society and animal shelter. Acts of kindness and compassion are always worth their weight in gold: shoveling a walk for a neighbor, writing a letter to an elder and volunteering at the local food bank are all ways to express your generosity.

All of the organizations I recommend have the highest rating by Charity Navigator, a trusted source. Always do your own research before donating, and choose organizations that align with your own values.

Supplying shelter:

Habitat for Humanity: “In 2023 Habitat for Humanity helped 13.4 million people build or improve a place to call home,” says the organization’s website. You can honor the humanitarian generosity of President Jimmy Carter and the memory of first lady Rosalynn Carter by funding a project or volunteering in your own community.

Supporting education:

ScholarMatch: Author Dave Eggers founded this nonprofit in 2010 as a way to help first-generation college students from low-income backgrounds attend college. They provide scholarships and full support all the way through to graduation.

Donors Choose: Prospective donors can choose a specific classroom project to fund — from donating art supplies and musical instruments to classroom technology and gym equipment.

American Indian College Fund: The mission is simple — to send Native American and Alaska Native students to college. Every year, around 4,000 scholarships are granted to motivated students. They also support accredited tribal colleges and universities.

Serving service members: The needs of veterans are wide-ranging. These organizations serve veterans.

Travis Mills Foundation: Founder Travis Mills lost portions of all of his limbs due to an IED explosion while serving in Afghanistan. He coined the term “recalibrated veteran” to describe those wounded in service. These veterans and their families are brought to a retreat center in Maine for an adaptive, barrier-free opportunity to regroup, relax and connect with other veterans and their families.

K9s for Warriors: “Determined to end veteran suicide, K9s for Warriors provides highly trained service dogs to military veterans suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injury and/or military sexual trauma,” the organization’s website states. In a beautiful symmetry, service dogs are rescued from shelters, and then humans and dogs rescue each other.

Emergency response for victims of war in Israel, Gaza and Ukraine

Project HOPE: According to the organization’s website, “In 1958, Project HOPE founder Dr. William B. Walsh worked with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to charter a U.S. Navy hospital ship for $1/year,” to deliver medical supplies to areas of conflict around the world. Now a worldwide emergency response organization, personnel in Israel, Gaza and Egypt are working with local authorities to coordinate the delivery of aid into both Israel and Gaza.

Direct Relief: Founded by an Estonian immigrant to America in 1945, this organization responds to natural disasters and conflict in America and around the world, providing emergency medical supplies and essentials directly to communities in need.

Other groups offering life-changing relief are Doctors Without Borders and International Rescue Committee.

WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene services): Safe drinking water is necessary for human and animal health and well-being. Water Mission is a Christian-based charity founded in South Carolina by Molly and George Greene, who were inspired to use their professional skill (building water treatment plants) to benefit those in dire need. Now with projects in 60 countries, the group builds water plants and trains local people to operate and maintain them — bringing safe drinking water to an estimated 8 million people.

Feeding people: The act of offering food is a beautiful mission of connection. These groups feed the hungry.

Meals on Wheels: Offering nutrition delivered to the door, this organization was a lifeline for the elderly during the pandemic, and beyond. Donate locally or sign up to volunteer through.

World Central Kitchen: Founded by chef José Andrés, World Central Kitchen mobilizes local chefs to deliver food and hot meals to first responders and displaced people around the world. WCK trucks containing food and water are now serving Gaza. Their motto: “Food is a universal human right.”

Reproductive rights:

Since its founding over a century ago, Planned Parenthood has provided reproductive health care, education and abortion services.

Interested donors should give directly to a clinic serving an underserved community — through a search on the organization’s website."

Carolyn Hax is away. The following first appeared Nov. 1, 2009. Dear Carolyn: I have recently reconnected with one of my high school boyfriends. Our breakup was extremely difficult and occurred during my junior year of high school, when I was 17. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Being furious and young, and believing I’d never see him or speak to him again, I told a number of lies concerning him, including telling one of my brothers that the boyfriend was gay.

It’s now five years later. We are both much more mature and are working to repair the old rift while trying to begin a new relationship. It’s going well so far, but the problem is my brother. I mentioned the old boyfriend’s name during a conversation with my brother’s wife, and my brother had a very negative reaction, which leads me to believe he remembers those awful things I said at the time.

Now I don’t know what to do. The old boyfriend and I are not making any sort of declarations yet. But when the time comes, what do I say to my family other than that I was young and angry, so I lied to get a little revenge for the pain he caused me?

— Not So Vindictive Anymore

Share this article Share

Not So Vindictive Anymore: “Other than”? But you haven’t even said that yet, despite an engraved invitation to do so the moment your brother had his “very negative reaction.”

The problem isn’t your brother. The problem is that you were unusually harsh on your ex-boyfriend, even for a wounded 17-year-old, and that you’ve closed the maturity gap only part of the way since then. It does sound as if you’ve renounced the practice of firebombing someone’s reputation, which is a good and necessary start. But your silence at the aforementioned crucial moment is just another way of hurting someone: You tacitly confirmed your brother’s opinion of your boyfriend — including any false impressions you planted — by doing nothing to contradict it.

And there’s also the matter of the language you use in your letter. You “believe” your brother “remembers” your accusations? You got a “little” revenge? For “the pain he caused” you? You admit you erred, yes, but you’re hedging mightily within that admission. To set the record straight (if you will), it’s not enough just to stop telling ugly lies. You have to cross over to full maturity by telling ugly truths, even when you don’t want to, even when there’s no purpose in telling them besides pure fairness, even when the ugliness you expose is your own.

“I understand why you reacted badly when I mentioned [boyfriend’s name] — and I’m the reason. I spread lies about him after we broke up. I told myself it was revenge for things he did to me, when in fact I just wanted to convince myself that I was a blameless victim. I realize now I was responsible for my share of the damage, and there was no excuse for what I did to him.”

That is what you need to say to your brother — not “when the time comes” (translation: when circumstances force your hand), but now, whether this relationship flies or not."

Dear Miss Manners: Should I send thank-you notes to my pre-K religion class students for the Christmas gifts they gave me? Thankfulness and generosity are key parts of most religions. Do you want to teach your young pupils that the latter is not worth noticing and that skipping the former is an option?

Dear Miss Manners: As a guest at my boyfriend’s house, I spent practically all day making a turkey and all of the trimmings for Christmas dinner. I told him that dinner would be ready at 5 p.m. I called him to come and eat when dinner was ready.

Instead of coming to the table, he made a phone call and talked for almost an hour, ignoring the dinner and me, while the food got cold. He could have made this nonessential call before or after dinner. When he finally did come to the table, he hurriedly ate, then left to watch TV.

You seem to have had more than one turkey at this meal. Miss Manners reminds you that the new year is a good time for a fresh start.

Dear Miss Manners: What’s your take on posting written instructions for guests on how to use the toilet in a private home?

I’ve seen notes about not flushing sanitary pads, notes about lighting a match after you’re finished and, the worst, notes telling male guests to sit down to pee. I mean, it’s not a truck stop — shouldn’t these folks trust the adults they’ve invited into their home to know how to use a bathroom?

Perhaps not, in which case they might consider a sign in the dining room stating, “Don’t spit on the carpet.”

Dear Miss Manners: My daughter got married in the country where she now lives. Many family members and friends were unable to attend, and so we held a second reception a few months later at our home in the U.S.

Two family members came to this event, left without saying goodbye and then sent a note a week later. In the note, they did not thank us for our hospitality, but instead scolded us for the food offered, which was not to their liking, complained that neither lunch nor dinner was served (the party was from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.), and protested that there was no wedding cake.

Have the rules changed? I was taught to be a good guest at events, and to write a note afterwards that says, basically, “Thank you for your hospitality. I had a lovely time.” Can you advise me here?

It’s odd that victims of rudeness often ask, as you did, whether the rules have changed.

You don’t really think that Miss Manners has nothing better to do than to announce, “It’s now fine to tell your hosts that you hated the food.” She advises you not to trouble these people with your hospitality again.

When Kelsey Hatcher delivered her baby last week, she smiled and cried while doctors cheered and clapped. But after Alabama doctors handed Hatcher her newborn a few minutes later, they got back to work. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight There was still another baby to deliver. Hatcher was pregnant with two fetuses in separate uteruses, which occurs in one of every million pregnancies, her doctors said. After doctors planned for seven months for a pregnancy they had never witnessed, they delivered Hatcher’s healthy babies last week.

Roxi, who developed in Hatcher’s right uterus, was born Tuesday. The next morning, Rebel, from Hatcher’s left uterus, was born via Caesarean section.

Hatcher and her fraternal twins returned to their Dora, Ala., home on Friday and spent their first Christmas together.

“Never in our wildest dreams could we have planned a pregnancy and birth like this; but bringing our two healthy baby girls into this world safely was always the goal,” Hatcher, 32, said in a statement on the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) hospital website. “ … It seems appropriate that they had two birthdays, though. They both had their own ‘houses,’ and now both have their own unique birth stories.”

Shweta Patel, Hatcher’s obstetrician at UAB, told The Washington Post that the babies’ deliveries filled the room with “excitement and happiness.”

“It was a sigh of relief that everyone was doing so well after the delivery,” Patel said.

Hatcher was born with uterus didelphys, a rare condition that forms two uterine cavities. The disorder increased Hatcher’s chances of miscarriages and premature births, but she and her husband, Caleb, had two daughters and a son who were born without complications.

In March, Hatcher unexpectedly became pregnant. She and Caleb hoped they could handle raising four kids, but they would soon learn there would be a fifth.

In May, an ultrasound nurse discovered fetuses in both of Hatcher’s uteruses. Hatcher said she laughed in disbelief.

She started feeling both fetuses kicking about 16 weeks into her pregnancy. Doctors told her that the babies could arrive hours, days or weeks apart.

While Hatcher didn’t know how the pregnancy would progress, she and Caleb decided to give the babies names that start with R — the same letter their other children’s names begin with.

Hatcher wanted to have both babies before Christmas so her family could spend the holiday together. While Hatcher’s original delivery date was Dec. 22, her doctors moved the date in hope of meeting her goal.

When the couple drove to UAB on Tuesday, Hatcher worried about potential problems, such as the babies needing a long time to be delivered, she said in an interview released by the hospital.

At UAB, doctors gave her Pitocin, a labor-induction drug, to prompt contractions in both uteruses. Doctors monitored both fetuses through ultrasounds to judge which baby should be delivered first. While Patel said the hospital staffed the operating room similarly to a traditional twin pregnancy, more nurses than usual monitored each uterus.

Doctors noticed the fetus in the right uterus was further along. A few hours later, Roxi, who weighed 7 pounds and 7 ounces, was born at 7:45 p.m.

“We knew that our time wasn’t done,” Patel said, “and we still had more work to do.”

Minutes later, doctors were monitoring the other fetus while Hatcher breastfed Roxi. Hatcher told doctors that she would wait any amount of time to birth both babies naturally. In her hospital room, Hatcher lay on her side with a yoga ball — shaped like a peanut — between her legs and held them off the bed in hope of inducing labor.

But Patel said the fetus in the left uterus wasn’t dropping into Hatcher’s pelvis, so the doctor suggested a C-section.

In the morning, the Hatchers returned to the operating room. Doctors weren’t sure what to do with Roxi, so they brought her into the delivery room in her bassinet.

When Rebel was born at 6:10 a.m., weighing 7 pounds and 3½ ounces, Patel said there was more cheering, clapping and crying. Patel said she carried Rebel above Roxi’s bassinet so the sisters could meet.

“That was our first moment of just us four together and really getting to breathe that in,” Hatcher said in an interview released by the hospital.

After Hatcher returned to her recovery room, she held the babies together for the first time, Patel said. When Hatcher lays Roxi and Rebel beside each other, she said, they inch closer and touch each other.

“There’s that connection there,” Hatcher said in the hospital’s interview. “How strong it will be as they grow up, we’ll see, but they definitely have a bond.”"

Of the three days of the Christmas holiday weekend in D.C., Christmas Day was by far the warmest, in what seemed a reversal of typical winter temperature trends. Saturday, the first day of the weekend, was not particularly chilly, with a high of 49 degrees. Sunday, Christmas Eve, reached a slightly warmer 51. But Christmas Day put both of those to thermal shame, registering a lofty high of 61 degrees.

It seemed a brighter day as well, with more sunshine at more hours, and with a more lavish use of blue to mix with tinges of gray in the coloration of the late December skies.

Monday’s 61-degree high was 14 degrees above the average high in Washington for Christmas Day. And once again, the winds, largely by their absence, made their important contribution to wintertime comfort. They seemed mostly meek, mild and placid.

Not only was Monday’s 61 warm for Christmas Day, but it was also the city’s warmest reading since Dec. 16, when it was also 61.

Weather changes and temperatures fluctuate. It has been far warmer than 61 on Christmas Day in the District. In 1964, it was 72, setting the record here for the date. It has also been colder. Only last year, the high on Dec. 25 reached barely two degrees above freezing, at 34.

However, 61 on Christmas deserves attention. On average, according to National Weather Service figures, Washington’s high temperature reaches 61 only after winter has ended. It is the average high for March 28.

In the meantime, in the sunshine and under the blue sky, on the banks of the unruffled Potomac River, an osprey circled lazily overhead. It seemed to keep its thoughts on the weather to itself.

Presumably it had not received many invitations to Christmas dinner, and in a spirit of avian self-reliance, was foraging on its own.

It circled slowly, perhaps 15 or 20 stories up. And as its wings tilted to make its tight aerial turns, the white feathers underneath suddenly caught the beams of the late afternoon sun. Reflecting the Christmas Day sunlight, they gleamed and shone."

LOS ANGELES — The Boston Celtics opened a four-game swing through California last week by blowing a lead against the Golden State Warriors, stirring up painful memories of the late-game struggles that prematurely ended recent postseason runs. Uncover your Newsprint: Find out what your 2023 reading says about you. ArrowRight Since then, Boston has left no doubt, taking care of business in blowout victories over the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Clippers before ruining the Los Angeles Lakers’ Christmas with a convincing 126-115 win Monday.

The Celtics used the holiday stage to state their case as the NBA’s best team and the favorites to win the 2024 title by immediately seizing control against their archrivals at Crypto.com Arena. Boston improved its record to a league-best 23-6, flashing improved balance on the heels of a splashy offseason that included trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. All five Celtics starters scored in double figures, and they put away the Lakers (16-15) with suffocating defense in the second half.

The new-and-improved Celtics, who rank third in offensive efficiency, fifth in defensive efficiency and second in point differential, have displayed greater consistency thanks to the league’s most talented starting lineup. Boston can score in volume even when star wings Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown struggle from the field as they did Monday, and its defense boasts size, athleticism, length and plenty of postseason experience.

“We expected to be good,” Tatum said. “We know what our ultimate goal is. We all know how to play the game. It was only a matter of time for us jelling. We’ve been playing really, really well. ... We haven’t had a low-post presence like [Porzingis] since I’ve been on the Celtics. He creates so many problems [for opposing defenses].”

Monday was emblematic of Boston’s ability to find successful counters and auxiliary options. Facing persistent questions about its dependence on the three-point shot, the Celtics went 13 for 42 (31 percent) from deep yet still cruised to the win thanks to a varied attack that applied constant pressure to the Lakers’ interior defense and a defensive effort that held the Los Angeles supporting cast in check.

Porzingis, who finished with a team-high 28 points and 11 rebounds, showed off his midrange game and his ability to finish at the rim. Holiday added 18 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, and Derrick White posted 18 points and 11 assists to go with several key defensive stops down the stretch.

“We’re like a really powerful engine,” Porzingis said. “We just have that margin. If the threes were falling tonight, it would have been a plus-20 or plus-25 game for us. ... We’ve been starting to run a bit more, get out in transition more. We’re even more dangerous when we get out and run.”

Boston sought to spoil the centerpiece of the NBA’s Christmas quintuple-header as soon as it started, racing to a 12-0 lead in the first three minutes. Moving the ball ahead of a Lakers defense that was a step slow, the Celtics extended their lead to 18 points before the first quarter ended.

“We came back a little lethargic,” Lakers Coach Darvin Ham said, noting his team had played six of its previous seven games on the road. “The whole Christmas circumstances of the holiday [and an] early game, it took us a little time getting going. ... We have a lot of work to do. It’s not so much our level of talent or our competition. We can’t skip the details. We can’t get bored with the details.”

Los Angeles pulled back into the contest during a second quarter marked by injuries and controversy. With four minutes left before halftime, Brown stumbled near midcourt as he tried to shake free for a pass and was rear-ended by Lakers forward LeBron James. The stars lay on the court side by side for an extended stretch; Brown favored his lower back as James held his left knee. The scene brought a hush to a festive building and conjured memories of James’s groin injury against the Golden State Warriors on Christmas 2018.

James exited the game but returned after a brief respite; Brown left Boston’s bench area and sat out for the rest of the half before reentering to start the third quarter.

Moments after the collision, James made it clear he was feeling no ill effects by soaring for a chase-down block of Tatum. To James’s dismay, he was whistled for a foul, prompting a coach’s challenge. The referees ruled that James had cleanly blocked Tatum but that Lakers forward Taurean Prince had committed a foul during the sequence. The ruling put Tatum at the free throw line and prompted boos from the home crowd.

Despite the injury scare and the highlight block that went for naught, the Lakers whittled the Celtics’ lead to one at halftime and took their first lead when James made a jump hook shortly after the break.

Anthony Davis was the Lakers’ driving force, posting a game-high 40 points to go with 13 rebounds and four assists. But the Lakers struggled to crack Boston’s switching defense as the Celtics reasserted themselves in the third quarter.

“They were just clicking on all cylinders,” Davis said. “The turnovers [and] the transition game hurt us tonight. Against a team like that, the best team in the league, they make you pay for it.”

Boston’s defensive scheme used Holiday and Brown to hound James while deploying the 7-foot-2 Porzingis near the rim as a help defender. Though Davis excelled, James finished with just 16 points, tied for his season low, to go with nine rebounds and eight assists. The four-time MVP checked out with nearly three minutes remaining and the result in hand for Boston as Los Angeles fell to 2-6 since winning the inaugural in-season tournament.

“I don’t think we’re where we want to be to compete versus the top teams until we continue to get better and better,” James said. “My knee is a little sore right now. The best thing is that finally the schedule is in our favor with two days before we have to play again. Just a freak play right there between me and Jaylen Brown — happy I was able to walk off under my power.”

Elsewhere on Christmas, Jalen Brunson scored a game-high 38 points to lead the New York Knicks to a 129-122 home victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, avenging three head-to-head losses this season. Milwaukee stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard scored 32 points apiece, but the Bucks, probably the biggest threat to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference, had no answers for Brunson and conceded 72 points in the paint.

The Denver Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors, 120-114, in a choppy and over-officiated contest in which Nikola Jokic and Stephen Curry struggled from the field. Jamal Murray scored a game-high 28 points, including back-to-back clutch jumpers in the final four minutes, to lift Denver to its fifth straight win. However, this wasn’t a signature performance for the defending champions, who enter Tuesday as the Western Conference’s No. 2 seed — two games behind the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The Miami Heat built a 21-point lead and held off a Philadelphia 76ers comeback bid for a 119-113 home win, but the contest lacked much relevance with headliners Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler sidelined with injuries. Heat rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. led the way with a game-high 31 points, and 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey endured a 4-for-20 shooting night.

Health absences also marred the nightcap: Dallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving and Phoenix Suns guard Bradley Beal missed out with injuries. Irving’s absence opened the door for Luka Doncic to come out gunning, and he tallied his 10,000th career point in the first quarter. Doncic reached the milestone in his 358th game, surpassing James (368) among active players as the fastest to 10,000 points.

Even so, the Mavericks and Suns looked incomplete without their core pieces. By the end of an unexpectedly anticlimactic day of basketball, Boston was the clear winner."
75,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtonpost.com/latest-headlines/,"As the pandemic adoption boom cools, pet shelters overflow",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/25/dog-cat-animal-shelter-adoption/,"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save

U.S. animal shelters will start 2024 the most overcrowded they have been in years, according to a broad survey of animal rescue facilities, a symptom of persistent economic concern as the country’s pandemic pet-adoption boom finally cools. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight There are roughly a quarter of a million more pets in animal shelters this holiday season than there were in the same period in 2022, according to Shelter Animals Count, a nonprofit that tracks unhoused pet populations.

That figure would be higher, said Stephanie Filer, the group’s executive director, if shelters were not already overcrowded and had more space to keep animals.

Pet adoptions skyrocketed during the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 1 in 5 households adopted a pet during the pandemic, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Even President Biden adopted a dog, Commander, and a cat, Willow.

At the pandemic’s height, 70 percent of U.S. households owned pets, according to the American Pet Products Association trade group (APPA), and 54 percent of all households owned dogs.

But as the economy turned sour and inflation rose to historic heights, consumers’ buying power dwindled and the pace of adoptions slowed. That, in turn, put a strain on rescue facilities, which have limited space to house unwanted cats and dogs, Filer said. Now about two-thirds of households own a pet, according to APPA, and half own dogs.

Pet populations, though, have continued to grow; owners skipped nearly 3 million spay or neuter surgeries in 2020 and 2021, according to research conducted by the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Shelters experienced a dramatic influx of puppies, including sought-after breeds, such as French bulldogs, or purposeful breed crosses, like labradoodles.

The pandemic, and the thousands of dollars in stimulus funding that individuals and households received, made pet ownership affordable for scores of families. The end of the pandemic, and the federal government’s fiscal tightening, threatened for a time to make pet ownership a stark economic divider between the middle and working classes.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in a largely successful attempt to cool inflation. But that caused the cost of animal care to increase dramatically, according to Brandy Keck, head of veterinary and pet-care facility lending for Live Oak Bank. Vets and pet-care businesses raised prices to cope both with higher demand and business costs, including borrowing, payroll and materials. The cost of veterinary services jumped 9 percent from November 2022 to November 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pet food costs rose 5.6 percent in the same period.

All of that added up to one result: Owning a pet got more expensive. And a lot more pets are stuck in shelters because of it.

Advertisement

“How we got to this point is truly a three-year snowballing trend,” Filer told The Washington Post. “It’s a perfect storm of the shelter system taking on all of the crises at once.”

Those crises could be starting to ease, though. Prospective pet owners generally decide whether to adopt an animal based on their economic outlook, experts say, and financial forecasts are brightening.

That could be a boon especially to the pet industry, which relies on cheap money to finance expensive equipment — such as X-ray machines in medical offices — and expand to serve growing demand.

In the first half of 2023, Keck said, veterinary and pet-care facility businesses pumped the brakes on new projects fearing an economy headed toward a recession.

By June, she sad, “It was like the floodgates opened again.” Pet industry businesses, seeing positive signs for adoption rates and consumer spending, started borrowing more, expanding services and increasing competition that could bring down consumer costs in the long-term.

But in this holiday season, animals in overcrowded shelters still need help. Households can volunteer to foster animals, Filer said, which dramatically increases dogs’ likelihood of adoption. Taking dogs on temporary outings or fostering them for a night or two can increase their odds of adoption by up to 1,400 percent, according to a 2023 study conducted by researchers at Arizona State University and Virginia Tech, and published in the journal Animals.

Pet owners who are struggling to provide for their animals should contact shelters or rescue organizations as soon as possible for help, Filer said. The organizations are often able to provide financial or material assistance so households don’t have to surrender their pets.

“Don’t reach out when you have no other option,” Filer said. “Reach out as soon as possible to see what your options are.”"

DONETSK REGION, Ukraine — “There was a new joy that had never happened before.” Inside a white-brick house near the front lines, a dozen soldiers were singing. The table in front of them gasped of Christmas: mushroom soup and fried hake; rounds of traditional bread — palyanytsya — the size of sheet pans; plates mounded with potato dumplings, some with silver coins hidden at their center for good luck.

It was Dec. 24, and Christmas had arrived with the first star in the night sky. Gone are the days of celebrating on Jan. 7, in the tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Ukraine voted in July to move the holiday up by two weeks — another axing of ties with Russia and a symbolic step toward the West.

It was another Christmas at war. Aid has stalled. Ammunition is running low. Victory feels elusive, the battle lines frozen like the weather. And yet they were lucky to be alive — tens of thousands of soldiers like them had already died as the war pressed into a new year.

Now, the men raised their voices in harmony — none louder than Myron’s.

“ … a bright star shined into the whole world!”

The 59-year-old soldier had spent two days cooking Ukraine’s 12 traditional Christmas dishes.

Hunched over a camping stove in the entryway, pots of water boiling, the only window turned liquid from steam. Slotting wood into a traditional oven – the size of a steamer trunk — to bake stuffed cabbage rolls, called holbutsi. Stamping dumplings from homemade dough with a yellow coffee mug. He moved in short, quick movements — his beard frizzy and graying, his laughter quick to explode — as he darted between rooms, through a door propped open with an ironing board.

Myron, who is being identified only by his first name for security reasons, knew the soldiers in his battery were cold and discouraged. They rotated through the trenches, running artillery reconnaissance on Russian forces several kilometers away. Now, they are stationed in a village where blue tarps cover homes where the roofs have been blown off, and vehicle checkpoints are dotted with Christmas trees. It is a blip in a region bearing the scars of last year’s fighting — streets dark and emptied, sunflower fields seeded with mines — even after liberation from Russian occupation last year.

The military post was an abandoned house — two rooms filled with the remnants of someone else’s life. Children’s drawings clung to the wallpaper, and schoolbooks were stacked on the living room shelves. There was no running water, but the heat and electricity worked fine. Here, Myron — a former appliance salesman — had toiled with makeshift equipment, selecting pans from a box on the floor and pulling military rations from a plastic bag. Tradition called for three varieties of fish, three types of bread with salt, on this day cupped in the base of an old water bottle. Quarts of sweet uzvar juice, a pot of honeyed kutia.

It took his mind off his village, near Sambir in western Ukraine, where his granddaughters were also tucking silver coins into their dumplings, greeting another Christmas without him. To bite into a coin, according to festive superstition, is to come into a year of wealth.

“War is war, but I don’t want to feel like [I’m] not at home,” a soldier, Lubomir, 40, told Myron as they cooked.

He sliced open the belly of yet another herring — guts spilling, bones tangled — until the house reeked of fish. Onion peels were scattered on the floor, mixing with concrete and dust.

“At home, we do better,” Myron replied.

At the center of the long table, a thick candle of yellow and blue — Ukraine’s national colors — flickered.

The men’s voices lifted.

“ … They fall on their knees and praise the King-God.”

To share a table was a gift. On the other side of the front lines, Russian soldiers could pinpoint the Ukrainians’ location by triangulating cell tower pings. Their families existed only in photos on silenced phones. Maybe later, Myron thought, he could call his granddaughters on the satellite phone. How many more Christmases like this would there be?

“It’s really hard without my family,” he said. “We call each other, but it’s not the same.”

Five-year-old Katya smiled up at him from his cellphone screen, red sweater polka-dotted with black. He had passed these Christmas traditions to his son, now 38, who is passing them to Katya and her 14-year-old sister. He taught them not to waste leftover bread dough, baking it in sheets on the stovetop for the cows or stray dogs. To half-undress and bathe in cold well-water before the meal. To eat by flickering light, the overhead bulbs flipped off, the room brightened by candles and the Christmas tree.

Myron had talked with his wife that morning to confirm the recipe for mushroom gravy. She sent a package to him at the house — packets of foraged mushrooms and dried white beans, purple-wrapped chocolates and a box heavy with cake, the frosting speckled with green-and-red sprinkles. The conversation had been too short. It always was.

But on this evening, the soldiers had each other. They arrived from their various posts clean-faced, neatly hooking their military jackets on the wall, packs of Marlboros winking from their pockets. They whispered prayers, a murmur like running water — so many hopes and dreams overflowing. The 29-year-old, uncertain whether he would sign another contract with the military. The 55-year-old, whose cherished daughter had been lost to a heart ailment years ago. The 40-year-old, whose three children are growing up without him.

Myron brought more dishes to the table, until there was no more space on the yellow cloth.

“Let us have as much guns and weapons as we have food,” said Serhii, 47, flashing a gold-toothed smile.

Plastic cutlery clicked against plastic bowls. Better not to waste water washing dishes — if there were even enough dishes to be had. Bread torn, soup slurped. The flash of a lucky coin pillowed inside a dumpling.

The men slowed. Again, the song swelled, long and mournful.

“ … give happy years to our glorious Ukraine.”

And again: “Give happy years to our glorious Ukraine!”

The singing lulled. The soldiers stepped outside, where snow sugared the woods and wheat fields. Twinkle lights hung from the eaves of the house, broken and dark. Their cigarette tips flared in the nighttime.

Somewhere in the distance, soldiers were celebrating in the trenches, unlucky in their rotation. Soon, they would trade places.

But for now, the table was still full."

correction A previous version of this article gave an incorrect name for the woman who sued JetBlue Airways in 2016. She is Maribel Martinez, not Mirabel Martinez. The article has been corrected. Spirit Airlines has apologized to the family of a 6-year-old boy who was placed on the wrong flight and landed more than 160 miles from where his grandmother was waiting to pick him up. But the airline has yet to explain how it happened. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. ArrowRight Grandmother Maria Ramos told television station WINK News that it was the boy’s first time on a plane on Thursday and that he was headed from Philadelphia to Fort Myers, Fla. She said that his bags arrived in Fort Myers but that the boy didn’t. Ramos panicked, she told the station.

“I ran inside the plane to the flight attendant, and I asked her, ‘Where’s my grandson?’” she said. Her grandson called her from Orlando, WINK reported, and she drove to pick him up.

“The child was always under the care and supervision of a Spirit Team Member, and as soon as we discovered the error, we took immediate steps to communicate with the family and reconnect them,” Spirit said in a statement shared by the TV station, adding it was conducting an internal investigation.

The Transportation Security Administration ensures that each passenger has a boarding pass before entering the secure area of an airport and wouldn’t be involved in the Spirit incident, Daniel Velez, a TSA spokesman, said Monday. He referred questions to the airline.

Spirit didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday. Efforts to reach Ramos were unsuccessful.

Such mishaps are uncommon, but when they have occurred, they have raised serious questions about safety and security and occasionally prompted litigation and regulatory inquiries.

In 2016, Maribel Martinez sued JetBlue Airways, alleging it mixed up her 5-year-old son’s flight details with those of another boy who was also flying out of the Dominican Republic. When Martinez arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to pick up her son, a boy she didn’t know was brought to meet her at the gate, according to the suit.

Her son, meanwhile, “was escorted to an unknown woman” at Logan International Airport in Boston, the suit says, “and was told he was being reunited with his mother.” The mother and son said they experienced emotional distress as a result. The litigation was settled in December 2016, an attorney for the plaintiffs said at the time. JetBlue didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2017, two brothers boarded a Tokyo-bound flight from Los Angeles on All Nippon Airways. Both had valid passports and boarding passes, but one of them had a United Airlines ticket and wasn’t supposed to be on the ANA flight. The plane returned to the United States midflight, and the incident gained widespread attention after the model Chrissy Teigen, who was on board, tweeted about the “flight to nowhere.”

A TSA spokesman said at the time that the FBI was looking into the incident, and ANA said it was working to determine how it happened. The airline didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.

In 2019, a 14-year-old boy traveling alone from North Carolina stopped in Newark for a connecting flight to Sweden, but United Airlines placed him on a Eurowings flight to Germany instead, his mother tweeted at the time. The Eurowings flight returned to the gate before taking off, United said at the time, after the crew realized the boy was on the wrong plane.

A Eurowings spokesperson said then that boarding for the flights to Sweden and Germany took place simultaneously at neighboring gates and was handled by “an external service provider,” and that the teen mistakenly received a boarding pass for the wrong flight.

“Miss Petula, there’s someone in the lobby here for you,” our security guard, Robin, said when she called up to my desk in our old 15th Street building. “She has a lot, and I’m talkin’ a LOT of, um, diapers,” Robin said, a little uneasily. “Can you come deal with this?”

This is a story about the Christmas spirit — that bursting, full-hearted, pine-spiced, jingle-bell mood — that we’re all soaking in right now.

Except that these diapers, this beautiful, thoughtful gift, came in April.

I had just written a column about Juan Jordan, one of the few single fathers living in what was once the shame of D.C.’s shelter system — an abandoned hospital that housed nearly 600 homeless children and their families — with his 1-year-old daughter after he was laid off.

Not only did readers send checks and gift cards for him, but several also showed up in our lobby with boxes of baby clothes, a playpen and this — a giant duffel bag of disposable diapers. Because every parent knows how crucial and pricey these little things are.

This was the spring of 2012, not even Christmas. Yet the gifts for Jordan and his little girl came in Santa-size bags.

Why? Because beyond politics and race, socioeconomics, nationality, sexuality and religion — the topics that occupy so much of our media diet — our humanity connects us through our struggles, our dreams and our triumphs year-round.

That human connection brings out the best in people. And it’s the biggest joy of this job.

How about when Christmas came this past August?

“I’m so proud to contribute to this young man’s future. I can’t think of a better investment to make than in America’s youth,” wrote Robert Scott Bass, in a message accompanying a $1,000 donation to the GoFundMe a reader set help send Kamari Felton to college.

I wrote about Felton this summer, after he’d been accepted to Frostburg State University and was about to move out of a homeless shelter and into a dorm and all of his funding was yanked out from under him.

The university and government officials finally got their acts together and restored his funding after we banged on in this column about the mess. But in the meantime, in the swampy malaise of a D.C. summer — with no holiday cheer or spirit of Christmas to move them — readers raised $42,900 that won’t just get him to college; it also will help keep him there.

“I struggled to pay for college, had to work full time through the whole process and owed over 50K,” Peggy Goodwin wrote in her GoFundMe message to Felton, along with a $10 donation. “This man doesn’t need a debt burden; he needs a hand. As a teacher I know many kids like this. Wish I could give him more.”

Her words, her actions are the more.

Over the 14 years I’ve written this column, the “more” has come in surprising and delightful ways.

One instance came the very first year I began the column, in 2009, from a suburban mother in Maryland who read about Ronnell Wilson.

Wilson was a college student who didn’t have a home and slept in offices and the library between classes at the University of the District of Columbia.

“I have a place for him,” she wrote in an email. Her side gig was renting out property to college students at the University of Maryland. She had a studio that was open, gave him the key and welcomed him, rent-free, for a year.

“No, please, keep my name out,” she said, when I tried to write a column about her and Wilson. The woman and I were in the same social circles; we’d see each other at children’s sports events or at the community pool. She’d wave, give me an update on Wilson, and that was it.

Twice, readers mobilized to help send entire youth football teams on trips their parents couldn’t afford.

It was the Chiefs in 2016, then the Gold Boyz last year — children from working-class neighborhoods who played their best on the fields, made it to the equivalent of the kid Super Bowl, then weren’t sure how they could pay to get there. Readers sent them.

In 2013, before GoFundMe became a thing, a Maryland post office was overwhelmed with nearly 300 letters that came from readers who were moved by a column about children who sing and their exacting, demanding director.

The choir kids at Northwestern High School in Hyattsville, nearly all of whom qualified for federally funded lunch programs, were the only American students invited to participate in a prestigious choral festival in South Africa, and they simply couldn’t afford to go, despite months of bake sales and fundraising performances.

This was a familiar disappointment for them, having turned down similar invitations to London, Vienna and Prague.

But in the March week that I published their post office box address and asked readers to forgo their Starbucks trip for one week and send these kids their frappuccino money instead, y’all sent more than $70,000 worth of checks that funded the journey.

“This is not my Starbucks allowance — it is my this week’s paycheck! I am a retired school secretary walking dogs,” wrote a donor who sent the choir $93 and a handwritten note on Disney stationery. “Go — sing your hearts out — we love you guys!”

It was a life-changing experience for the teens, most of whom had never been on a plane before they flew all the way to Africa and sang outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela was receiving care.

It’s our shared humanity, our recognition of struggle, our delight in triumph that have made every month feel like Christmas for this columnist.

Thank you, dear readers."

LONDON — King Charles III’s annual festive address saw the British monarch posing next to a replantable tree festooned with dried oranges while delivering a message that acknowledged the “growing awareness” of the need to protect the planet. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The monarch’s Christmas message has long been a fixture in Britain — like wearing silly Christmas sweaters or colored paper hats.

The speeches are uncontentious — and this year’s was no exception. But it’s also one of the few times the monarch delivers a speech they write themselves, without government guidance, meaning royal watchers pay close attention. The address is normally viewed by millions in Britain and Commonwealth countries.

Charles, like his mother Queen Elizabeth II did during her long reign, used his speech to reference current affairs, the Christian faith and his reflections on the year of his coronation. This is Charles’s second Christmas address since ascending to the throne in 2022.

The king touched on an issue close to his heart — the environment. Charles is a noted conservationist known for his strong opinions on climate change. But during his first year as monarch, he kept much of his advocacy in check. And while he has acknowledged he can’t speak out the way he once did, Charles this year has shown that the environment is still a subject he cares about deeply.

In 2023, he gave a speech to world leaders at COP28 — the U.N. Climate Change Conference — visited eco-themed projects on a state visit to France, and launched a food waste project on his 75th birthday.

He also made sustainability a key point in his Christmas messaging and the backdrop of the broadcast.

“During my lifetime I have been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home which we all share,” Charles said.

“I find great inspiration now from the way so many people recognize this — as does the Christmas story, which tells us that angels brought the message of hope first to shepherds. These were people who lived simply amongst others of God’s creatures. Those close to nature were privileged that night,” he said.

In the video, Charles was seen standing next to a living Christmas tree that journalists were told would be replanted after the broadcast. The decorations included dried oranges, pine cones and paper.

In a carefully worded section, he addressed what he described as “conflict around the world” although he refrained from naming specific countries.

“At a time of increasingly tragic conflict around the world, I pray we can also do all in our power to protect each other,” he said. “The words of Jesus seem more than ever relevant: ‘Do to others as you would have them do to you.’ Such values are universal, drawing together our Abrahamic family of religions, and other belief systems, across the Commonwealth and wider world.”

The speech was prerecorded from a room in London’s Buckingham Palace that leads out onto the balcony where royals gather on significant occasions to wave at their subjects, as they did during Charles and Camilla’s coronation earlier this year.

The king did refer to the coronation. “My wife and I were delighted when hundreds of representatives of that selfless army of people — volunteers who serve their communities in so many ways and with such distinction — were able to join us in Westminster Abbey for the coronation earlier this year.”

He called volunteers “an essential backbone of our society.”

Unlike Elizabeth, Charles did not surround himself with family photos. In previous years, the photos on display have drawn attention for who is — and isn’t — included.

Charles and Camilla were not at Buckingham Palace on Christmas Day. They were at their Sandringham estate where they attended their traditional Christmas Day church service. The king’s disgraced brother, Prince Andrew, joined the royal family at the church service, as did Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.

They were joined by several other members of the House of Windsor, including William and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their three children."

As she watched the conflict in Israel and Gaza unfold this fall, 17-year-old Asmmaa Zaitar finally had enough. She decided to organize a protest in support of the Palestinian cause in a very unlikely place — a courthouse in Huntsville, Ala. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Initially, Zaitar, a second-generation Palestinian American, was terrified that no one would show up. Zaitar knew it was a conservative town better known for divisive debates over Confederate monuments than for protests against a war overseas.

But as the rally began, dozens of fellow Muslims, including women wearing headscarves, trickled into the town square in late October carrying signs decrying Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip. Local media showed up, and Zaitar knew she had succeeded in connecting her city — and its growing Muslim population — to a conflict halfway around the globe.

“People now know there is a Palestinian voice in this city,” said Zaitar, a student at the University of Alabama at Huntsville. “Everyone has a voice and can say whatever feels right and fight back using our voice.”

Across the nation, from the Deep South to Appalachia and relatively rural communities in the Midwest, protests in support of the plight of Palestinians are springing up, showcasing the continued spread of the U.S. Muslim population into the country’s heartland. Children of refugees from Muslim nations organized many of the demonstrations, evidence of a political awakening among a new generation of young Americans who are helping to shape U.S. public opinion in support of a cease-fire in the Middle East.

In the process, the antiwar rallies in places such as Huntsville, Oxford, Miss., and Boone, N.C., are creating a sense of community among Muslims who only recently would not have dreamed they could pull off such gatherings. Now, they vow to continue their activism to influence the public debate while showcasing the emerging political power of American Muslims.

“Just because we live here in the U.S. doesn’t mean we are isolated or separated,” said Hammad Chaudhry, 24, a second-generation Pakistani American who helped organize several pro-Palestine demonstrations at Appalachian State University in Boone. “We live in a globalized world where the tiniest thing somewhere can have a massive impact somewhere else.”

The burst of activism — which Muslim scholars said would have been unthinkable just a decade or so ago — is rooted in the broad spread of Muslim families throughout the United States.

From the first major waves of migrants to the U.S. in the 1970s through the 1990s, Muslims tended to cluster in just a handful of states, including New York, California and Michigan.

Like many immigrant groups, over time some moved elsewhere in search of jobs and opportunities. More recently, many new refugees from Muslim-majority nations have settled directly into states in the South or Midwest in hopes of finding more affordable housing.

A 2017 analysis from Pew Research Center estimated that 3.45 million Americans are Muslim, three-quarters of whom are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Overall, the nation’s Muslim population is far younger than the overall U.S. population, with Pew finding 35 percent of Muslims were 18 to 29 that year, compared to 21 percent of the overall population.

Using data on religious institutions gathered by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, a Washington Post analysis found that 234 U.S. counties have seen an increase in the number of Muslim congregations since 2000, representing around 7 percent of counties nationwide. In 217 counties, mosque membership doubled between 2000 and 2020. And across the nation, the number of mosques has more than doubled since 2000, according to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a research firm that studies Muslim communities.

Some of the most noticeable growth has taken place in smaller areas that are now seeing more young Muslims speak up about the plight of Palestinians. Huntsville, for example, now has four Muslim congregations with 3,935 members, compared to two congregations with 1,218 members in 2000.

Youssef Chouhoud, an assistant professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., said young Muslims are now “coming of age” and speaking out about Middle East politics in ways that prior generations of American Muslims were unable to.

Chouhoud, 40, an Egyptian American, said initial waves of Muslim immigrants were focused on securing jobs and settling into U.S. culture. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in particular, Chouhoud said, younger Muslim Americans felt an urgency to “fit in” and become “ambassadors for their faith” by going about their lives in nonconfrontational ways.

“It was a period where many Muslims were thinking we just need to get our house in order, and kind of make sure we grounded ourselves first and foremost because there was search for what it means to be an American Muslim,” said Chouhoud. “Now, the folks that are in college and high school, they are very comfortable in their own skin, and they are much more willing to raise their voice and protest with regards to any number of issues.”

Khalil Abualya is a second-generation Palestinian American who grew up in Tennessee. A pre-med and pharmacy student at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, the 23-year-old senior said he never thought his college experience at “Ole Miss” would include becoming an antiwar activist

Then during his sophomore year, he went to a meeting of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), which has about 100 members. Oxford’s local mosque has also seen its membership grow from 163 to 275 congregants since 2000, according to a Washington Post analysis.

“I thought, ‘Wow, there are a lot more Muslims than I previously thought,’ and that made me want to become more active,” Abualya said.

After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Abualya and other members of the MSA started seeing activists at other colleges take sides in the conflict.

Enraged by estimates showing two-thirds of those killed in Gaza during Israel’s strikes have been women or children, Abualya and other members of the MSA decided it was time for an antiwar presence at Ole Miss, a college that was at the forefront of battles over civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s.

“I feel like Oxford, Mississippi, especially considering where it is, is a very pivotal place for something like this,” Abualya said. “We can show the dialogue is open here too.”

The first event was a “silent protest” at the Grove, a tree-lined park that is synonymous with student life, including tailgating before college football games.

Before the event, Abualya, like Zaitar, was anxious whether anyone would show up. He was thrilled when about 50 people did, standing mostly in silence to bring attention to the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

After the event, Abualya began setting up a table about three times a week near the student union to try to influence others with one-on-one appeals. He shares photographs of civilian casualties in Gaza and provides his perspective on the history of the conflict.

He believes he is making a difference.

“A lot of people, especially a minority like myself, when you think of the South, think of stereotypes like very ignorant people who don’t care about other people,” Abualya said. “But you have all of these people that walk up to the table … and they just want to talk. They just want to hear about what is happening and have an open dialogue.”

In recent weeks, amid a wave of protests, polls show U.S. public opinion has shifted in favor of a cease-fire. An Economist-YouGov poll in late November found 65 percent of U.S. citizens support Israel and Hamas agreeing to a cease-fire, while 16 percent opposed it, and 19 percent were not sure.

Still, support for a cease-fire doesn’t mean Americans are less supportive of Israel or its right to defend itself against Hamas, the controlling political force in Gaza. The Economist-YouGov poll found 38 percent saying they sympathize more with the Israelis, 11 percent with the Palestinians and 28 percent both equally.

Nationally, pro-Palestinian protesters have been cast by critics as Hamas sympathizers or antisemitic. The new protesters say that is unfair. “They can say whatever they want, and we can’t do anything about that, except use our voice and fight back,” Zaitar said.

Many of the protesters said they do not support Hamas nor the tactics they used when militants invaded Israel with brutal force, killing and kidnapping scores of Israeli civilians. But the protesters do not believe Israel’s response has been proportional and argue their demonstrations are designed to showcase how Palestinians civilians are now swept up in the conflict.

As they step up their organizing, young Muslims have faced Islamophobia and hate-filled heckling.

In Huntsville, vehicles circled the protesters and called the demonstrators “rapists,” Zaitar recalled. Salma Treish, 21, who helped organize the protest at Appalachian State, recalls that some people drove by “yelling degrading things.”

Demonstrators in both cities, however, said their own experiences with Islamophobia have been rare.

“I know this can be considered a more conservative area, but in my personal experience, dealing with people more conservative than I am, they have mostly been willing to listen to what I have to say,” said Treish, a second-generation Palestinian American. “And that is the beauty of all of it, the beauty of having all of these conversations has been pretty great.”

A key driver of many of the demonstrations in smaller communities has been social media. One Instagram account, Appalachians for a Free Palestine, has been widely disseminating statements that seek to connect the Palestinian cause to the historical labor and economic struggles of Appalachia.

“It would be hypocritical to celebrate our ancestors for fighting against their oppressors by any means necessary while criticizing Palestinians for doing the same,” one Instagram post read.

Khurram Tariq, a Pakistani American cancer specialist in Boone, said the cause of Palestinian rights has become far easier to promote in rural North Carolina because the Muslim community has grown larger and more established.

Boone did not have a mosque until two years ago, after one of Tariq’s patients reached out to him to say they also were Muslim.

The pair identified even more Muslims in town, including Appalachian State students and several Afghan refugees who had recently settled there. An Islamic center that includes a mosque, which Tariq oversees, opened in July of 2022. Boone, a city of 18,000 residents, now also has a restaurant and bakery that conforms to Islamic dietary restrictions.

The growing community, Tariq said, showcases how the “diaspora has matured.” That has given more space for their children to pick up the Palestinian cause with vigor.

“The Palestinian issue had been there, festering for years, but to be honest we were just too busy with our lives,” said Tariq, 40. “But now you have their children, and their children, speaking out … and the Muslim diaspora in general has become more active as the generations evolve.”

Chouhoud, from Christopher Newport University, added the plight of Palestinians now “unites Muslims across the board,” a departure from recent decades when U.S. Muslims had been more focused on domestic issues or the fallout from the war on terror.

“The plight of Palestinians, perhaps while not absent from considerations, just didn’t take priority because foreign policy in general was not taking a priority,” Chouhoud said.

The surge in activism today coincides with steadily increasing political clout for Muslim Americans that could have repercussions in 2024.

Ahead of the 2020 election, after four years of Donald Trump policies that included a travel ban from five Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East or Africa, Muslim leaders made a major push to increase voter turnout.

Emgage USA, a political group focused on turning out Muslim voters, concentrated on 12 states that had a combined 1.5 million registered voters who identified as Muslim. That Election Day, Emgage USA estimated that 71 percent of them cast a ballot, about five points higher than the nation’s 66 percent overall turnout rate.

Muslim voters overwhelmingly supported Biden, and helped the Democrat carry several states including Michigan and Virginia.

Wa’el Alzayat, chief executive of Emgage, said efforts to organize Muslim voters in 2020 and last year’s midterm election laid the groundwork for today’s protests. Young Muslims have become comfortable discussing thorny political issues and are now angry over “what is happening in their name” in U.S. foreign policy, Alzayat said.

“This reminds me of some of the protest dynamics that occurred during the ‘Arab Spring,’ said Alzayat, referring to the anti-government protests that swept the Middle East in the early 2010s. “Young people are receiving their information on social media, and mobilizing alongside each other, and this represents the decentralized reality of social media reaching everyone at the same time, everywhere.”

Alzayat said he expects will continue to broaden their activism. “This is a generational thing,” he said.

Chaudhry, who helped organize the protest at Appalachian State, said he’s already seeing his fellow Muslims becoming more vocal about other overseas conflicts, including the civil war in Sudan, as well as domestic issues such as affordable housing and health care.

But Chaudhry warns that Biden’s support for Israel — and perceptions that he has been less sympathetic to the victims in Gaza — will make it harder for him to turn out young Muslims in the 2024 general election, even if it’s a rematch with Trump.

“I think young Muslims ideally would want to vote for Biden, but they feel like Biden isn’t hearing what they have to say and it’s kind of wearing them down,” Chaudhry said. “So, they feel they have no option but to withdraw their support.”

Still, Chaudhry adds, “that doesn’t mean they will be supporting Donald Trump either.”

Many young organizers feel their movement now transcends traditional politics, the fallout from a war that feels exceptionally personal.

Abualya, the organizer at Ole Miss, notes that most of his family still lives in Gaza or the West Bank. At least in Mississippi, Abualya said, first- and second-generation Americans can use a staple of their American citizenship — free speech — to try to change others’ opinions.

“We believe our parents [living overseas] didn’t have this tool,” Abualya said. “So, since they didn’t have this opportunity, and I have this opportunity, why wouldn’t I take it?”

In a statement late Monday night, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that President Biden ordered the strikes against Kataib Hezbollah, a militia with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

“These precision strikes are a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias, including an attack by Iran-affiliated Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups on Erbil Air Base earlier today,” Mr. Austin said.

The Pentagon chief said the strikes are “intended to disrupt and degrade capabilities of the Iran-aligned militia groups directly responsible” for the attack.

Three Americans were injured. One service member is in critical condition, officials said.

“Let me be clear — the president and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests. There is no higher priority,” Mr. Austin said.

He aid that the U.S. does “not seek to escalate conflict in the region” but is “fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities.”

Mr. Biden was briefed shortly after the initial Christmas morning attack in Iraq, White House officials said, and he was presented with options to strike back against Kataib Hezbollah.

The president “directed strikes against three locations utilized by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups focused specifically on unmanned aerial drone activities,” White National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.

“The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue,” she said.

U.S. Central Command, which oversees America’s military presence in the region, said early indications show that the U.S. strikes “destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants.”

Monday’s airstrikes are the latest in a string of clashes between U.S. troops in the Middle East and Iranian proxies, though not Iran itself.

Mr. Biden has come under intense pressure to more forcefully respond to the repeated, direct attacks on American personnel.

The Iran-backed militias now routinely target American forces stationed in Iraq and Syria. The attacks have grown more frequent in the months since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

Hamas, like the militias targeting U.S. forces in the region, is supported by Iran.

Separately, U.S. forces over the weekend shot down at least four attack drones launched by Houthi rebels operating in Yemen. The Houthis are also backed by Iran. The drones were headed toward an American warship operating in the Red Sea.

Before Monday’s attack in Iraq, attacks by Iran-backed militias had wounded at least 21 U.S. service members and led to one American contractor dying from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place.

‘Tensions between the two nations are now near their highest point since early 2020, when a U.S. airstrike killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

84,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Israeli airstrike in Syria kills high-ranking Iranian general,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/seyed-razi-mousavi-iranian-general-kiiled-in-israe/,"BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike Monday in a Damascus neighborhood killed a high-ranking Iranian general, Iranian state media said.

Iranian officials and allied militant groups in the region vowed revenge for the killing but did not immediately launch any retaliatory strike.

The killing of Seyed Razi Mousavi, a longtime adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria, comes amid ongoing fears of the Israel-Hamas war sparking a regional spillover. Iran-backed groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq have launched attacks on Israel and its allies in support of Hamas.

Clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Hezbollah and Israel have continued to intensify, with daily exchanges of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the frontier.

In the Red Sea, attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen against ships they believe to be connected to Israel have disrupted trade and prompted the launch of a U.S.-led multinational naval operation to protect shipping routes.

Iran-backed militias in Iraq operating under an umbrella group dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq have also launched more than 100 attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, which they have said are in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel.

The group claimed an attack on a U.S. base next to the commercial airport in Irbil in northern Iraq on Monday. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with regulations, confirmed the attack and said it had caused injuries but did not provide further details.

Israeli strikes killed two other generals earlier this month in Syria.

Israel on Monday struck the Sayida Zeinab neighborhood, located near a Shiite Muslim shrine, Iran’s official news agency IRNA and Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. IRNA described Mousavi as a close companion of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020.

Neither the Israeli military nor Syrian state media immediately issued a statement about Monday’s attack. Israeli officials declined to comment.

Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi in a statement said that Mousavi was “martyred while serving as an adviser for the resistance front, defending holy shrines in Syria as well as safeguarding Islamic ideals.” He threatened that the “Israeli regime will definitely pay for this crime.”

Hossein Akbari, Iran’s ambassador to Syria, condemned the killing, saying that Mousavi was in Syria as a “formal military advisor.”

“(Israel) will definitely get a response to this crime at the right time and the right situation,” Akbari said, speaking from Damascus.

Though IRNA didn’t provide other details about the attack, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli military targeted Mousavi after he entered a farm in the area, which allegedly was one of several offices for Hezbollah. The Lebanese militant group, alongside Iran and Russia, has played a key military role in keeping President Bashar Assad’s government in power throughout the Syrian conflict.

Hezbollah in a statement called Mousavi “one of the best of brothers who worked to support the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon for decades of his honorable life.”

Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years. It doesn’t usually acknowledge its airstrikes on Syria. But when it does, Israel says it’s targeting Iran-backed groups there that have backed Assad’s government."
85,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Migrant caravan in Mexico marks Christmas Day by trudging toward U.S.,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/mexico-migrant-caravan-marks-christmas-day-by-trud/,"HUIXTLA, Mexico — Christmas Day meant the same as any other day for thousands of migrants walking through southern Mexico: more trudging under a hot sun.

There were no presents, and Christmas Eve dinner was a sandwich, a bottle of water and a banana handed out by the Catholic church to some of the migrants in the town of Álvaro Obregón, in the southern state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala.

Migrants spent Christmas night sleeping on a scrap of cardboard or plastic stretched out under an awning or tent, or the bare ground.

In the morning, it was waking as usual at 4 a.m., to get an early start and avoid the worst of the heat, walking to the next town, Huixtla, 20 miles (30 kilometers) away.

Karla Ramírez, a migrant from Honduras who was traveling with other adults and four children, got to Álvaro Obregón too late Sunday to get any of the food being given out by the church. So they had to buy whatever little they could afford.

“It was sad: we have never, ever been in the street before,” Ramírez said. “Our Christmas dinner was some mortadella, butter and tomato, with a tortilla.”

Mariela Amaya’s seven-year-old son didn’t understand why they had to spend Christmas this way. Amaya, also from Honduras, tugged the hand of her tired, recalcitrant son as they walked.

“They don’t understand why we have to do this to get a better life,” Amaya said. Nor did the governments of Mexico and the United States, she said.

“Why can’t they help us? We need their help,” she said.

What little help there was came from local families, one of whom gave out tamales - traditional seasonal fare - and water to the passing migrants.

The migrants included single adults but also entire families, all eager to reach the U.S. border, angry and frustrated at having to wait weeks or months in the nearby city of Tapachula for documents that might allow them to continue their journey.

Mexico claims it doesn’t give out transit visas, but migrants keep hoping to get some sort of document so they could at least take buses to the border.

“This journey has been really hard for us migrants. We need the (Mexican) immigration office and the government to have some pity on us, and give us a safe conduct pass,” said Jessica García, a migrant from Venezuela.

Mexico says it detected 680,000 migrants moving through the country in the first 11 months of 2023.

At around 6,000 people, the migrant caravan that set out Sunday was the largest one since June 2022, when a similarly sized group departed Tapachula.

And like the 2022 caravan - which started as U.S. President Joe Biden hosted leaders in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas - this year’s Christmas caravan came a few days before U.S. officials are to meet with their Mexican counterparts in Mexico City to explore ways of stemming the number of migrants showing up at the U.S. southwest border.

The Mexican government has already said it is willing to help try to block migrants from crossing Mexico; the government had little choice, afte r U.S. officials briefly closed two vital Texas railway border crossings, claiming they were overwhelmed by processing migrants.

That put a chokehold on freight moving from Mexico to the United States, as well as grain needed to feed Mexican livestock moving south. The rail crossings have since been reopened, but the message was clear.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to arrive in Mexico City Wednesday to hammer out new agreements to control the surge of migrants seeking entry into the United States. The U.S. delegation will also include Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.

This month, as many as 10,000 migrants were arrested per day at the U.S. southwest border.

In May, Mexico agreed to take in migrants from countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba who had been turned away by the U.S. for not following rules that provided new legal pathways to asylum and other forms of migration.

But that deal, aimed at curbing a post-pandemic jump in migration, appears to be insufficient as numbers rise once again, disrupting bilateral trade and stoking anti-migrant sentiment among conservative voters in the U.S.

Arrests for illegal crossing topped 2 million in each of the U.S. government’s last two fiscal years, reflecting technological changes that have made it easier for migrants to leave home to escape poverty, natural disasters, political repression and organized crime."
86,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Russian nuclear weapon shipments complete, Belarus leader says",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/alexander-lukashenko-says-russian-nuclear-weapon-s/,"TALLINN, Estonia — The president of Belarus said Monday that Russia has completed its shipments of tactical nuclear weapons to his country, an initiative that raised strong concerns in neighboring Poland and elsewhere in the region.

President Alexander Lukashenko said at a meeting of a Moscow-led economic bloc in St. Petersburg that the shipments were completed in October, but he did not give details of how many weapons were sent or where they have been deployed.

Tactical nuclear weapons, which are intended for use on the battlefield, have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles. Russia said it would maintain control over those it sends to Belarus.

Lukashenko has said that hosting Russian nuclear weapons in his country is meant to deter aggression by Poland, a NATO member. Poland is offering neighbor Ukraine military, humanitarian and political backing in its struggle against Russia’s invasion and is taking part in international sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

Russian troops based in Belarus invaded Ukraine from the north in the war’s opening days, but Belarusian forces are not known to have participated,"
87,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Christmas barrage: Ukraine says it foiled massive Russian drone assault,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/christmas-barrage-ukraine-says-it-foiled-massive-r/,"Ukraine intercepted more than two dozen attack drones and several missiles fired by Russian forces in a massive Christmas Day barrage, Ukrainian military officials said Monday.

The massive onslaught comes as Ukraine tries to fend off creeping advances by Russian troops in the eastern portion of the country. Russia has seized momentum in the nearly 2-year-old war, as Ukraine pleads with the U.S. and European Union to provide more financial and military aid as soon as possible.

Such foreign aid has been crucial in bolstering Ukraine‘s air defense system, which has helped foil aerial attacks from the much larger, better-equipped Russian military. That was the case Monday, Ukrainian officials said, as the country’s air defenses shot down 28 Russian attack drones and at least two missiles. The Russian assault targeted Ukrainian positions in the Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Khmelnytskyi regions, Ukrainian military officials said in a social media post.

Ukrainian officials also said they shot down two Russian fighter jets, one over the Donetsk region and another flying over the Black Sea.

Hours before the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to rally his nation amid the grim reality that Russia seems to be gaining the upper hand.

“Christmas Eve is the time of the longest nights of the year. But tomorrow, the day starts getting longer, the light starts prevailing. The light is getting stronger. And step by step, day by day, the darkness retreats,” Mr. Zelenskyy said in a Christmas Eve address. “And in the end, darkness will lose. Evil will be defeated. Today, this is our common goal, our common dream, and this is what our common prayer is for today. For our freedom. For our victory. For our Ukraine.”

But Russia claimed its own successes over the Christmas holiday.

Over the past two days, Russian forces shot down several Ukrainian rockets, anti-ship missiles, at least four Ukrainian aircraft and 49 attack drones, the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday.

The Kremlin is touting its successes in the war so far, with 2024 looming and questions mounting about how long Ukraine can hold on.

“A total of 558 aircraft, 261 helicopters, 10,040 drones, 442 anti-aircraft missile systems, 14,299 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 1,189 multiple rocket launchers, 7,479 field branch artillery weapons and mortars, as well as 16,660 units of special tactical vehicles have been destroyed since the beginning of the special military operation,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, according to the country’s state-run Tass News Agency.

Russian gains could accelerate rapidly without immediate U.S. and EU aid, Ukrainian and Biden administration officials have warned in recent weeks.

Lawmakers left Washington last week after failing to pass President Biden’s $61.4 billion aid package for Ukraine. Republicans in both chambers want to see more money for border security attached to any Ukraine aid bills, while House GOP leaders also are demanding that the White House explain Ukraine‘s roadmap to a decisive win over Russia.

Publicly, the administration is standing firmly behind Ukraine and insisting that Mr. Putin will fail.

“He thinks his strategy of waiting us out while sending wave after wave of young Russians into a meat grinder of his own making will pay off,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters last week. “On one and only point I agree with Putin: America’s ongoing support is critical to enabling Ukraine‘s great soldiers and citizens to keep up their fight to ensure Russia‘s war remains a strategic failure.”

“Putin is betting that our divisions will prevent us from coming through for Ukraine. We have proven him wrong before. We will prove him wrong again,” Mr. Blinken said.

What’s different this time, however, is the combination of Russian battlefield momentum and cracks in Western support. As the U.S. and EU grapple over whether to provide more aid to Ukraine, there are growing questions about what exactly that aid would achieve, short of holding the line and preventing a clear Russian victory.

Indeed, Mr. Putin now seems to be the most confident he’s been since the conflict began in February 2022.

“Our troops are holding the initiative,” Mr. Putin said during a year-end press conference last week. “We are effectively doing what we think is needed, doing what we want. Where our commanders consider it necessary to stick to active defenses they are doing so, and we are improving our positions where it’s needed.”

“The enemy has suffered heavy casualties and to a large extent wasted its reserves while trying to show at least some results of its so-called counteroffensive to its masters,” Mr. Putin said. “All attempts by the West to deliver us a military defeat, a strategic defeat, were shattered by the courage and fortitude of our soldiers, the growing might of our armed forces and the potential of our military industries.”

88,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Navalny located in penal colony 3 weeks after contact lost,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/navalny-imprisoned-russian-opposition-leader-locat/,"MOSCOW (AP) — Associates of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Monday that he has been located at a prison colony above the Arctic Circle nearly three weeks after contact with him was lost.

Navalny, the most prominent foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism. He had been imprisoned in the Vladimir region of central Russia, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Moscow, but his lawyers said they had not been able to reach him since Dec. 6.

His spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was located in a prison colony in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenetsk region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow.

The region is notorious for long and severe winters; the town is near Vorkuta, whose coal mines were among the harshest of the Soviet Gulag prison-camp system.

“It is almost impossible to get to this colony; it is almost impossible to even send letters there. This is the highest possible level of isolation from the world,” Navalny’s chief strategist, Leonid Volkov, said on X.

Transfers within Russia’s prison system are shrouded in secrecy and inmates can disappear from contact for several weeks. Navalny’s team was particularly alarmed when he could not be found because he had been ill and reportedly was being denied food and kept in an unventilated cell.

Supporters believed he was deliberately being hidden after Putin announced his candidacy in Russia’s March presidential election. While Putin’s reelection is all but certain, given his overwhelming control over the country’s political scene and a widening crackdown on dissent, Navalny’s supporters and other critics hope to use the campaign to erode public support for the Kremlin leader and his military action in Ukraine.

Navalny has been behind bars in Russia since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Before his arrest, he campaigned against official corruption and organized major anti-Kremlin protests.

He has since received three prison terms and spent months in isolation in Penal Colony No. 6 for alleged minor infractions. He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated."
89,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Egypt floats ambitious plan to end Israel-Hamas war as death toll in an Israeli strike rises to 106,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/egypt-floats-ambitious-plan-to-end-israel-hamas-wa/,"CAIRO (AP) — Egypt has put forward an ambitious, initial proposal to end the Israel-Hamas war with a cease-fire, a phased hostage release and the creation of a Palestinian government of experts who would administer the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank, a senior Egyptian official and a European diplomat said Monday.

The proposal, worked out with the Gulf nation of Qatar, has been presented to Israel, Hamas, the United States and European governments but still appeared preliminary. It falls short of Israel’s professed goal of outright crushing Hamas and would appear not to meet Israel’s insistence on keeping military control over Gaza for an extended period after the war.

Israel’s War Cabinet, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, will meet later Monday to discuss the hostage situation, among other topics, an Israeli official said, but would not say if they would discuss the Egyptian proposal. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

Word of the proposal comes as Israeli airstrikes heavily pounded central and southern Gaza, crushing buildings on families sheltering inside. In the Maghazi refugee camp, rescue workers pulled dozens more bodies from the wreckage hours after a strike leveled a three-story building and shattered others nearby. At least 106 people were killed, according to hospital records seen by The Associated Press, making it one of the deadliest strikes of Israel’s air campaign.

The war has devastated large parts of Gaza, killed more than 20,400 Palestinians and displaced almost all of the territory’s 2.3 million people.

The mounting death toll among Israeli troops — 17 since Friday and 156 since the ground offensive began — could erode public support for the war, which was sparked when Hamas-led militants stormed communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 and taking 240 hostages.

Israelis still largely stand behind the country’s stated goals of crushing Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and releasing the remaining 129 captives. That’s despite rising international pressure against Israel’s offensive, and the soaring death toll and unprecedented suffering among Palestinians.

Egyptian proposal

The Egyptian proposal was an ambitious bid not only to end the war but also to lay out a plan for the day after.

It calls for an initial cease-fire of up to two weeks during which Palestinian militants would free 40 to 50 hostages, among them women, the sick and the elderly, in return for the release of 120-150 Palestinians from Israeli prisons, the Egyptian official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks.

At the same time, negotiations would continue on extending the cease-fire and the release of more hostages and bodies held by Palestinian militants, he said.

Egypt and Qatar would also work with all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, to agree on the establishment of a government of experts, he said. The government would rule Gaza and the West Bank for a transitional period as Palestinian factions settle their disputes and agree on a roadmap to hold presidential and parliamentary elections, he added.

In the meantime, Israel and Hamas would continue to negotiate a comprehensive “all-for-all” deal, he said. This would include the release of all remaining hostages in return for all Palestinian prisoners in Israel, as well as the Israeli military’s withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian militants’ halting of rocket attacks into Israel. Close to 8,000 Palestinians are held by Israel on security-related charges or convictions, according to Palestinian figures.

Egyptian officials discussed the outline of the proposal with Ismail Haniyeh, the Qatar-based political leader of Hamas, who visited Cairo last week. They plan to discuss it with the leader of the Islamic Jihad group, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, who arrived in Cairo on Sunday, the official said. The militant group, which also took part in the Oct. 7 attack, said it was prepared to consider releasing hostages only after fighting ends.

A Western diplomat said they are aware of Egypt’s proposal. But the diplomat, who demanded anonymity to discuss the matter, doubts that Netanyahu and his hawkish government would accept the entire proposal. The diplomat gave no further details.

Inside Gaza

Israel’s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than two-thirds of the more than 20,400 Palestinians killed have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

After Sunday night’s strike in the Maghazi camp, first responders and residents searched through the ruble, many with their bare hands or simple tools. The dead continued to flow into Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where men prayed over several dozen bodies laid out on the ground. Sobbing relatives peeled open body bags to get a last look or kiss the face of a loved one. One man wept as he hugged a body wrapped in bloody plastic sheeting, the size of a small child.

Another man knelt over the body of a relative, screaming, “I swear to God, he was a man. I swear to God, he was better than the whole of Hamas.”

The devastation of the war over the past weeks has brought sporadic eruptions of anger against Hamas, something that would have previously been unthinkable during the group’s 16-year rule over Gaza.

Apart from the Maghazi deaths, the bodies of another 80 people killed in strikes across central Gaza were also received at the hospital from late Sunday to early Monday, hospital records showed.

Since Friday, 17 Israeli soldiers have been killed in combat, most in southern and central Gaza – an indication of the heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis.

“The war exacts a very heavy price from us, but we have no choice but to continue fighting,” Netanyahu said Sunday.

There has been widespread anger against his government, which many criticize for failing to protect civilians on Oct. 7 and promoting policies that allowed Hamas to gain strength over the years. Netanyahu has avoided accepting responsibility for the military and policy failures.

“Over time, the public will find it hard to ignore the heavy price paid, as well as the suspicion that the aims that were loudly heralded are still far from being attained, and that Hamas is showing no signs of capitulating in the near future,” wrote Amos Harel, military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.

In northern Gaza, Palestinians reported heavy Israeli bombardment and gunfire in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, an area Israel had claimed to control. The Israeli military said it had completed the dismantling of Hamas’ underground headquarters in northern Gaza.

Israel faces international criticism for the civilian death toll, but it blames Hamas, citing the militants’ use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.

Israel also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive. The military says it had detained hundreds of Palestinians, including more than 700 who were transferred to Israel for further interrogation about suspected ties to militants. It has denied abuse allegations and said those without links to militants are quickly released.

Speaking from a hospital bed in Rafah after his release, Khamis al-Burdainy of Gaza City said Israeli forces detained him after tanks and bulldozers partly destroyed his home. He said men were handcuffed and blindfolded.

“We didn’t sleep. We didn’t get food and water,” he said, crying and covering his face.

90,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/israeli-airstrike-kills-iranian-general-in-syria/,"BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike Monday in a Damascus neighborhood killed a high-ranking Iranian general, Iranian state media said.

Iranian officials and allied militant groups in the region vowed revenge for the killing but did not immediately launch any retaliatory strike.

The killing of Seyed Razi Mousavi, a longtime adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria, comes amid ongoing fears of the Israel-Hamas war sparking a regional spillover. Iran-backed groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq have launched attacks on Israel and its allies in support of Hamas.

Clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Hezbollah and Israel have continued to intensify, with daily exchanges of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the frontier.

In the Red Sea, attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen against ships they believe to be connected to Israel have disrupted trade and prompted the launch of a U.S.-led multinational naval operation to protect shipping routes.

Iran-backed militias in Iraq operating under an umbrella group dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq have also launched more than 100 attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, which they have said are in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel.

The group claimed an attack on a U.S. base next to the commercial airport in Irbil in northern Iraq on Monday. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with regulations, confirmed the attack and said it had caused injuries but did not provide further details.

Israeli strikes killed two other generals earlier this month in Syria.

Israel on Monday struck the Sayida Zeinab neighborhood, located near a Shiite Muslim shrine, Iran’s official news agency IRNA and Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. IRNA described Mousavi as a close companion of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020.

Neither the Israeli military nor Syrian state media immediately issued a statement about Monday’s attack. Israeli officials declined to comment.

Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi in a statement said that Mousavi was “martyred while serving as an adviser for the resistance front, defending holy shrines in Syria as well as safeguarding Islamic ideals.” He threatened that the “Israeli regime will definitely pay for this crime.”

Hossein Akbari, Iran’s ambassador to Syria, condemned the killing, saying that Mousavi was in Syria as a “formal military advisor.”

“(Israel) will definitely get a response to this crime at the right time and the right situation,” Akbari said, speaking from Damascus.

Though IRNA didn’t provide other details about the attack, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Israeli military targeted Mousavi after he entered a farm in the area, which allegedly was one of several offices for Hezbollah. The Lebanese militant group, alongside Iran and Russia, has played a key military role in keeping President Bashar Assad’s government in power throughout the Syrian conflict.

Hezbollah in a statement called Mousavi “one of the best of brothers who worked to support the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon for decades of his honorable life.”

Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of war-torn Syria in recent years. It doesn’t usually acknowledge its airstrikes on Syria. But when it does, Israel says it’s targeting Iran-backed groups there that have backed Assad’s government."
91,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Ukraine says it shot down Russian fighter jets and drones as the country officially marks Christmas,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/russian-fighter-jets-and-drones-shot-down-as-ukrai/,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s air force on Monday reported that it shot down two Russian fighter jets during the night along with two cruise missiles and 28 Shahed-type drones.

The report said the attacks were aimed at southern and central regions of Ukraine, but that no casualties were immediately known. It said that 31 drones were launched in all, but details of what the three that weren’t intercepted may have struck weren’t given.

A summary from the Ukrainian presidential office said that one civilian was killed and at least four wounded in Russian attacks over the previous 24 hours. The death occurred in the town of Chornobaivka in the Kherson region, which is partly under Russian control and experiences daily fighting.

Ukraine observed Christmas on Monday, the first time the country has officially marked the holiday on Dec. 25 rather than the Jan. 7 date followed by some Orthodox countries, including Russia.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed legislation in July to move the public holiday’s date.

Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, but the faith is divided between two churches, one of which had long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church.

The Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which didn’t recognize the authority of the Russian church and had been regarded as schismatic, was granted full recognition in 2018 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s top authority.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was a branch of the Russian church, announced in 2022 after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that it was breaking ties with Moscow and considered itself autonomous. However, its parishes continue to follow the same liturgical calendar as the Russian church and will observe Christmas on Jan. 7."
92,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Shipping firm Maersk says it’s preparing for resumption of Red Sea voyages after attacks from Yemen,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/maersk-shipping-firm-says-its-set-for-resumption-o/,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Shipping firm Maersk says it is preparing to allow vessels to resume sailing through the Red Sea, thanks to the start of a U.S.-led multinational naval operation to protect shipping from attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Houthi attacks have led to a major disruption of shipping through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, one of the most important arteries for trade in oil, natural gas, grain and consumer goods between Europe and Asia.

Maersk said in a statement Sunday that “we have received confirmation that the previously announced multi-national security initiative Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) has now been set up and deployed to allow maritime commerce to pass through the Red Sea-Gulf of Aden and once again return to using the Suez Canal as a gateway between Asia and Europe. ”

The company said it was working on plans for the first vessels to make the journey “and for this to happen as soon as operationally possible.”

The Houthis are Iranian-backed rebels who seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014, launching a grinding war against a Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore the government. The Houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region, but the attacks have increased since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

The rebels have threatened to attack any vessel they believe is either going to or coming from Israel. That has escalated to apparently any vessel, with container ships and oil tankers flagged to countries like Norway and Liberia being attacked or drawing missile fire.

Major shipping companies include Maersk have been avoiding the Red Sea and sending their ships around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. That added what analysts say could be a week to two weeks of voyages. The disruption also hiked fuel and insurance costs."
93,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Pope Francis blasts the weapons industry as he makes a Christmas appeal for peace in the world,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/pope-francis-knocks-weapons-industry-as-he-makes-c/,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Monday blasted the weapons industry and its “instruments of death” that fuel wars as he made a Christmas Day appeal for peace in the world and in particular between Israel and the Palestinians.

Speaking from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica to the throngs of people below, Francis said he grieved the “abominable attack” of Hamas against southern Israel on Oct. 7 and called for the release of hostages. And he begged for an end to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the “appalling harvest of innocent civilians” as he called for humanitarian aid to reach those in need.

Francis devoted his Christmas Day blessing to a call for peace in the world, noting that the biblical story of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem sent a message of peace. But he said that Bethlehem “is a place of sorrow and silence” this year.

Francis’ annual “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and the World”) speech typically offers a lament of all the misery facing the world, and this year’s edition was no different. From Armenia and Azerbaijan to Syria and Yemen, Ukraine to South Sudan and Congo and the Korean peninsula, Francis appealed for humanitarian initiatives, dialogue and security to prevail over violence and death.

He called for governments and people of goodwill in the Americas in particular to address the “troubling phenomenon” of migration and its “unscrupulous traffickers” who take advantage of innocents just looking for a better life.

He took particular aim at the weapons industry, which he said was fueling the conflicts around the globe with scarcely anyone paying attention.

“It should be talked about and written about, so as to bring to light the interests and the profits that move the puppet strings of war,” he said. “And how can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?”

Francis has frequently blasted the weapons industry as “merchants of death” and has said that wars today, in Ukraine, in particular, are being used to try out new weapons or use up old stockpiles.

He called for peace between Israel and Palestinians, and for the conflict to be resolved “through sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community.”"
94,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,King Charles III’s annual Christmas message from Buckingham Palace to include sustainable touches,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/king-charles-iiis-christmas-message-from-buckingha/,"LONDON (AP) — King Charles III will give his second Christmas message from Buckingham Palace in front of a live tree decorated with sustainable ornaments.

The message to be broadcast at 3 p.m. on Monday will be the king’s second holiday address since he ascended the throne but the first since his coronation in May.

The natural decorations adorning the tree were made from wood, dried oranges, brown glass, pine cones and paper. The tree will later be replanted, the palace says.

Charles has promoted environmental causes, such as protecting wildlife and combating climate change long before it became popular, throughout much of his life. He spoke at the beginning of the month at the U.N.’s COP28 climate summit in Dubai.

Last year, in his first Christmas message as monarch, Charles evoked memories of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and paid tribute to the “selfless dedication” of Britain’s public service workers.

Many of those workers spent much of the past year in a fight with the government over pay, creating disruptions in transportation, education and adding to already long wait times at hospitals as doctors, nurses and ambulance workers walked off the job - some for several days at a time - throughout the year.

While Elizabeth delivered her address from a desk, Charles last year stood by a Christmas tree at the church on the grounds of Windsor Castle where his parents are buried.

This year, he will speak from a room in Buckingham Palace that leads to the balcony where members of the royal family assembled after his coronation ceremony."
95,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,276 Indians stuck in a French airport for days for a human trafficking probe have left for India,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/airplane-stuck-for-days-in-france-for-human-traffi/,"VATRY, France (AP) — A charter plane grounded in France for a human trafficking investigation departed Monday for India with 276 Indians aboard, authorities said. The passengers had been heading to Nicaragua but were instead blocked inside a rural French airport for four days in an exceptional holiday ordeal.

Associated Press reporters outside the Vatry Airport in Champagne country saw the unmarked Legend Airlines A340 take off after the crew and passengers boarded the plane.

The regional administration said that 276 of the original 303 passengers were en route to Mumbai, and that 25 others requested asylum in France. Those who remained were transferred to a special zone in Paris‘ Charles de Gaulle airport for asylum-seekers, it said. The passengers grounded in France had included a 21-month-old child and several unaccompanied minors.

The remaining two passengers were initially detained as part of a human trafficking investigation but were released Monday after appearing before a judge, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. The judge named them as ‘’assisted witnesses” to the case, a special status under French law that allows time for further investigation and could lead to eventual charges or to the case being dropped.

The Legend Airlines A340 plane stopped Thursday for refueling in Vatry en route from Fujairah airport in the United Arab Emirates for Managua, Nicaragua, and was grounded by police based on an anonymous tip that it could be carrying human trafficking victims.

Prosecutors wouldn’t comment on whether the passengers’ ultimate destination could have been the U.S., which has seen a surge in Indians crossing the Mexico-U.S. border this year.

French authorities are working to determine the aim of the original flight, and opened a judicial inquiry into activities by an organized criminal group helping foreigners enter or stay in a country illegally, the prosecutor’s office said.

It did not specify Monday whether human trafficking — which the U.N. defines as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit” — is still suspected.

The Vatry airport was requisitioned by police for days. Local officials, medics and volunteers installed cots and ensured regular meals and showers for those held inside. Then it turned into a makeshift courtroom Sunday as judges, lawyers and interpreters filled the terminal to carry out emergency hearings to determine the next steps.

Some lawyers at Sunday’s hearings protested authorities’ handling of the situation and the passengers’ rights, suggesting that police and prosecutors overreacted to the anonymous tip.

The Indian Embassy posted its thanks on X, formerly Twitter, to French officials for ensuring that the Indians could go home. French authorities worked through Christmas Eve and Christmas morning on formalities to allow passengers to leave France, regional prosecutor Annick Browne told The Associated Press.

Foreigners can be held up to four days in a transit zone for police investigations in France, after which a special judge must rule on whether to extend that to eight days.

Legend Airlines lawyer Liliana Bakayoko said some passengers didn’t want to go to India because they had paid for a tourism trip to Nicaragua. The airline has denied any role in possible human trafficking.

The U.S. government has designated Nicaragua as one of several countries deemed as failing to meet minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking. Nicaragua has also been used as a migratory springboard for people fleeing poverty or conflict because of relaxed or visa-free entry requirements for some countries.

96,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Afghan schoolgirls are finishing sixth grade in tears. Under Taliban rule, their education is over",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/25/afghan-girls-are-finishing-sixth-grade-in-tears-un/,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Bahara Rustam, 13, took her last class at Bibi Razia School in Kabul on Dec. 11 knowing it was the end of her education. Under Taliban rule, she is unlikely to step foot in a classroom again.

In September 2021, a month after U.S. and NATO troops withdrew from Afghanistan following two decades of war, the Taliban announced that girls were barred from studying beyond sixth grade.

They extended this education ban to universities in December 2022. The Taliban have defied global condemnation and warnings that the restrictions will make it almost impossible for them to gain recognition as the country’s legitimate rulers.

Last week, U.N. special envoy Roza Otunbayeva expressed concern that a generation of Afghan girls is falling behind with each day that passes.

Last week, an official in the Education Ministry said Afghan girls of all ages are allowed to study in religious schools known as madrassas, which have traditionally been boys-only. But Otunbayeva said it was unclear if there was a standardized curriculum that allowed modern subjects.

Bahara is holding onto her education and pores over textbooks at home. “Graduating (from sixth grade) means we are going to seventh grade,” she said. “But all of our classmates cried and we were very disappointed.”

There was no graduation ceremony for the girls at Bibi Razia School.

In another part of Kabul, 13-year old Setayesh Sahibzada wonders what the future holds for her. She is sad she can’t go to school anymore to achieve her dreams.

“I can’t stand on my own two feet,” she said. “I wanted to be a teacher. But now I can’t study, I can’t go to school.”

Analyst Muhammad Saleem Paigir warned that excluding women and girls from education will be disastrous for Afghanistan. “We understand that illiterate people can never be free and prosperous,” he said.

The Taliban have barred women from many public spaces and most jobs, all but confining women to their homes."
97,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Biden orders strike on Iranian-aligned group after 3 U.S. troops injured in Iraq,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-25/biden-orders-strike-on-iranian-aligned-group-after-3-u-s-troops-injured-in-iraq,"WASHINGTON — President Biden ordered the U.S. military to carry out retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed militia groups after three U.S. servicemembers were injured in a drone attack in northern Iraq.

National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said one of the U.S. troops suffered critical injuries in the attack that occurred earlier Monday. The Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, under an umbrella of Iranian-backed militants, claimed credit for the attack that utilized a one-way attack drone

Biden, who is spending Christmas at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, was alerted about the attack by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan shortly after it occurred on Monday and ordered the Pentagon and his top national security aides to prepare response options to the attack on Erbil Air Base.

Sullivan consulted with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Biden's deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, was with the president at Camp David and convened top aides to review options, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity.

Within hours, Biden convened his national security team for a call in which Austin and Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Biden on the response options. Biden opted to target three locations used by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, the official said.

The U.S. strikes were carried out at about 4:45 a.m. on Tuesday in Iraq, less than 13 hours after the U.S. personnel were attacked. According to U.S. Central Command, the retaliatory strikes on the three sites, ""destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants.""

""The President places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm's way,"" Watson said. ""The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue.""

The latest attack on U.S. troops follows months of escalating threats and actions against American forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the devastating war in Gaza.

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. Iranian-backed militias have carried out dozens of attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two months ago.

The U.S. has also blamed Iran, which has funded and trained Hamas, for attacks by Yemen's Houthi militants against commercial and military vessels through a critical shipping choke point in the Red Sea.

The Biden administration has sought to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spiraling into a wider regional conflict that either opens up new fronts of Israeli fighting or that draws the U.S. in directly. The administration's measured response — where not every attempt on American troops has been met with a counterattack — has drawn criticism from Republicans.

The U.S. has thousands of troops in Iraq training Iraqi forces and combating remnants of the Islamic State group, and hundreds in Syria, mostly on the counter-IS mission. They have come under dozens of attacks, though as yet none fatal, since the war began on Oct. 7, with the U.S. attributing responsibility to Iran-backed groups.

""While we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,"" Austin said in a statement.

From ceiling fans to refrigerators, the Energy Department is updating dozens of efficiency standards that will reduce climate-warming greenhouse gases and save Americans billions of dollars a year. As good as these savings may sound, the standards also are a flashpoint in the culture war, as NPR's Jeff Brady reports.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: A suburban Philadelphia rowhouse is about to get a new heating system.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING)

BRADY: Down in the basement, the old boiler is gone and a new, more efficient one sits waiting to be connected.

JIMMY STOYKOV: We are replacing a standard 80% boiler with a 95% condensing boiler.

BRADY: Jimmy Stoykov owns Oval Heating And A/C and says the old boiler turned 80% of the energy from natural gas into heat. The new condensing boiler boosts that to 95%, saving the homeowner 15% on their gas bill.

(SOUNDBITE OF ELECTRIC DRILL REVVING)

BRADY: A condensing boiler or furnace is more efficient because it reduces the amount of heat that goes up the chimney. It recycles the heat and puts it in your house instead. Installation requires more work, a new vent out the side of the house and a new pipe to drain condensation. That's extra cost, and it's why gas utilities oppose a new standard that only more efficient condensing furnaces can meet. Dave Schryver heads the American Public Gas Association and worries that higher installation costs of those furnaces will hurt business.

DAVID SCHRYVER: When you add the cost associated with the replacement of the unit as well as the cost associated with the venting, it can become cost prohibitive for some people, which would result in them fuel switching to electric heat.

BRADY: His group is challenging the new standard in court. Groups like Gas Utilities have an ally in former President Donald Trump. He's also not a fan of efficiency standards. For example, he claims newer dishwashers don't work as well as older, less efficient ones.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: I had people saying they'd washed their dishes and they pressed the button five times. So in the end, they're probably wasting more water than if they did it once.

BRADY: Trump is joined by many conservatives in criticizing efficiency standards, but peer-reviewed research shows newer appliances actually work better. Shanika Whitehurst of Consumer Reports says her group's extensive testing bears that out.

SHANIKA WHITEHURST: Making appliances more energy efficient does not affect their durability and quality. All of that, from a durability-quality perspective rests on the hands of the manufacturer and their designers.

BRADY: Efficiency opponents also claim new requirements restrict consumer choices. Here is Pennsylvania Republican Representative Scott Perry speaking to an Energy Department official at a hearing last summer.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SCOTT PERRY: Thank you very much for limiting our choices. We thought we were free in America until we met you folks.

BRADY: That official pointed out that reviewing standards is required by law, and the Trump administration got behind schedule, says Joanna Mauer with the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.

JOANNA MAUER: So what you're seeing right now is the Biden administration trying to catch up on updating standards that haven't been revised for a decade or more. And pretty simply, if it's going to save you money, they're proposing an update.

BRADY: That process of approving new efficiency standards could get streamlined in coming months. That's because Mauer's group reached agreement in September with appliance manufacturers. Together, they're recommending tighter standards for refrigerators, freezers, wine chillers, washers, dryers, dishwashers and cooking stoves. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

In South Africa, Christmas is more about beach and barbeque than snow and eggnog. But what did the country's most famous figure like on his Christmas table? Reporter Kate Bartlett spoke to Nelson Mandela's former chef about South Africa's first democratically elected president and his love of food.

KATE BARTLETT, BYLINE: I'm at the house in Johannesburg that Nelson Mandela lived at while he was president. Now it's a luxury hotel where, for a price, you can sleep in the anti-apartheid icon's old bedroom. His chef of 22 years works here now and is preparing lunch in the kitchen, where onions are sizzling and she's recreating some of Madiba's favorite dishes.

XOLISWA NDOYIYA: Do you have any orders on your pastry sites today?

BARTLETT: Chef Xoliswa Ndoyiya says her late boss loved oxtail stew and his palate skewed towards traditional Xhosa fare.

NDOYIYA: Tata loved his stomach, but you must make sure that you was feeding him healthy. As long as you have been doing well and there is no oil whatsoever in his plate, then you are doing very well.

BARTLETT: He also loved a fermented milk dish so much that once, when he was on presidential business in London and craving the dish, Ndoyiya says she had to send it to him from South Africa by plane.

NDOYIYA: When he came back from the trip, that's when he told me that - you are going to go to prison because you smuggled food. And yeah, that was the joke of it.

BARTLETT: Mandela himself spent 27 years in prison for his fight against racist white rule. Many of his Christmases were in a cell on Robben Island. But after his release, the holiday was usually celebrated in his Eastern Cape village of Qunu and was always a feast.

NDOYIYA: We would have a turkey. We would have chicken and beefs and lamb and all that. It was a special Christmas every year for him because it was not only for him and his family, it was for his village because he used to have a Christmas for the children of the village.

BARTLETT: Mandela, who died this month 10 years ago, once recalled his own spartan childhood Christmases in an interview with Pieter-Dirk Uys in 1994.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NELSON MANDELA: I remember the Christmases that I had as a child, and it is the only time when we could have in the countryside sugar because tea and coffee were reserved for elderly people. But at Christmas, then they gave us, you know, some coffee and sugar.

BARTLETT: Chef Ndoyiya says she's keeping Mandela's favorite flavors alive, having recently published a cookbook of his best-loved recipes. Kate Bartlett, NPR News, Johannesburg.

100,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Think you know the best pie in America? Try Wisconsin's paper bag apple pie,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-25/think-you-know-the-best-pie-in-america-try-wisconsins-paper-bag-apple-pie,"ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

What's your favorite holiday sweet - cookies, cakes? Well, for pie lovers in southeast Wisconsin, the market The Elegant Farmer offers a special treat - pies baked in a paper bag. Food Network and Gourmet magazine have called their apple pie the best pie in America. Lina Tran of member station WUWM has more.

LINA TRAN, BYLINE: A steady stream of customers strolls through the market in Mukwonago, a village 30 minutes southwest of Milwaukee. Golden pies nestled in butter-stained paper bags tempt them from the counter.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, yeah. It's almost like eating apple pie and candy at the same time.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The crust is fantastic.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It's a treat. It's a really - quite the treat.

TRAN: But this isn't your grandma's pie. It's a boulder, packed with crispy Ida Red apples and topped with a craggy crust that tastes and snaps like a sugar cookie. Ernie and Jackie Hill are picking one up for their daughter and son-in-law. They've been coming here for decades.

Does anyone fight for, like, the biggest piece or something?

ERNIE HILL: They got to be even for sure, got to be even.

TRAN: Whoever cuts the pie is lucky. They get dibs on the sugary goo stuck in the bag.

E HILL: You save it.

TRAN: Well, you eat it.

E HILL: You eat it. Yeah, I mean, you don't throw it in the garbage is what I'm telling you.

JACKIE HILL: I fold it in half with the stuff showing and lick it (laughter).

TRAN: To prep for the season's pilgrimage of pie lovers, Elegant Farmer starts baking in January. They stock freezers all year to stay on top of orders that come from all over the country.

KATIE SCHMIDT: Everything from, like, September to the end of the year, it's just a nonstop thrill ride for us.

TRAN: That's Katie Schmidt, the director of operations. Her parents own the place now. The story goes, in the '70s, the previous owners were looking for something to sell and thought apple pie. The owner's wife found a recipe for pie baked in a paper bag. Then, in a lucky mistake, an ingredient in the topping got doubled, amping up the crunch. They would never say which it was, and now the paper bag is their hallmark.

SCHMIDT: So it starts fully closed. And then as you get through the baking process, we cut a hole in the top to really crisp up that flaky top crust.

TRAN: And no, the bag doesn't catch on fire.

SCHMIDT: I think that's what people get concerned about. We've been just fine.

TRAN: The bag captures moisture. Tara Jensen, a baker and author in Virginia, says steam is crucial in baking for a tender crumb. Over Thanksgiving, Jensen's brother didn't have anywhere to go for the holiday. She learned Elegant Farmer would ship him a pie - a pie baked in a paper bag.

TARA JENSEN: I had never seen that before, and I've been baking apple pie for 20 years.

TRAN: So she tried making one herself with a clean grocery bag and her own pie recipe.

JENSEN: I think there's something about the extra level of moisture, like the water in the air reacting with the sugar in the streusel. It almost made a creme brulee crackle on the top.

TRAN: The siblings ripped the bags open like Christmas presents.

JENSEN: You know, he was going through some personal struggles. I just had twins. And we just had this nice moment of like, cool, we just baked this unusual pie in a paper bag, and it brought us together.

TRAN: Katie Schmidt says that's what makes her proud to work at Elegant Farmer.

SCHMIDT: People come up to me and they have memories. And they're just like, oh, this is something that we have at our family gathering every year. I try to remember that when, you know, we're in our scheduling, and I'm like, these are going out to actual people.

TRAN: As much as crust matters, it's about the family and friends who share it. For NPR News, I'm Lina Tran in Milwaukee.

And I'm Scott Detrow with a Christmas story 65 years in the making.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRENDA LEE SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

DETROW: It starts when an up-and-coming rock-and-roll prodigy named Brenda Lee steps into a Nashville studio and records this track.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

BRENDA LEE: (Singing) Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop. Mistletoe hung...

DETROW: It wasn't an immediate hit, but in the years since, the song has become a holiday classic. For years it's made the Billboard charts each December, scratching the itch for anyone chasing that sentimental feeling.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

LEE: (Singing) ...Voices singing, let's be jolly. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Rockin' around...

DETROW: But for all that success, the song had never managed to hit No. 1 until this year. This month, with a promotional push from Brenda Lee's label, it finally topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. We're going to revisit my earlier conversation with Lee, who, by the way, is a whole lot bigger than that one holiday hit. When we spoke, she could still barely believe that she had a new No. 1.

LEE: Well, you know what? That is still not connecting with my brain. I'm just so thrilled for the writer. I was very close to the writer, Johnny Marks, and I wish he was here to witness all this. But it's a great song. It's a wonderful song, and, Lord, has it been good to me. I never thought that a Christmas song would be my signature song.

DETROW: Yeah.

LEE: But it is, and I'm proud of it.

DETROW: You know, there's always a moment to me every November where I'm in the store and I hear a Christmas song for the first time, and I think, oh, all right, it's Christmas season. I'm wondering - do you have a moment each year where you hear yourself in a store or out there, when you hear ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" for the first time for the season? And what does that feel like?

LEE: It still feels pretty surreal. It really does. And when I say that, people say, oh, Brenda, good Lord. That thing came out when you were 12 or 13 or however old you were. I said, but you know what? It never gets old.

DETROW: Can we go back to when you first recorded it? - because you just mentioned right there you were 13 when the song came out, and I think this latest generation of fans have been surprised to learn you were so young because your voice sounds so full in the recording. You do not sound like a 13-year-old. I mean, what was going on in your life at that time? What do you remember about going into the recording studio and recording the song?

LEE: Well, I remember that my great producer, Owen Bradley - he had the air conditioning turned to zero because we recorded it, of course, in the summer. And he had a Christmas tree up, and we just had a great time doing it. You know, good songs are easy to do, and I think we did that one maybe in one rehearsal and one take.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRENDA LEE SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

DETROW: You know, this past few weeks, there's been so much attention. You've been climbing the charts. There's been this push to get this to No. 1. And, of course, Mariah Carey is the other singer who, in recent years, has been so identified with the No. 1 Christmas hit. Have you and her had any conversation in recent weeks, I'm wondering?

LEE: No, but I'd love to. I love Mariah. I'm...

DETROW: Yeah.

LEE: ...A big fan. Her Christmas song is great. You know, there's room for all of us, and...

DETROW: Yeah.

LEE: ...If it's good, it's everything, so...

DETROW: I - well, I listen to both of you a lot around this time of year, so I appreciate you both as well.

LEE: I bet you do. I bet you get tired of us.

DETROW: No, not for another few weeks (laughter).

LEE: Well, that's big of you. Thank you so much (laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

LEE: (Singing) ...In the new old-fashioned way.

DETROW: You mentioned before you are totally fine with the fact that this is the song that is in people's minds, but I wanted to talk about the rest of your career, if you're up for it, for a few minutes.

LEE: Absolutely.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DUM DUM"")

LEE: (Vocalizing). (Singing) Oh, yeah.

DETROW: There's an anecdote that's floated around a lot of the profiles that mentions that there was one point in time where The Beatles opened for you.

LEE: That's exactly right. I used to work with the guys when I first started going to England, touring over there and just loved them. I was closest, I guess, to John, knew they were going to be huge, brought back a little acetate that they made for me. And I took it to my record company, and I said, I need you to hear these guys, and I need you to sign them. Well, they turned them down. And, of course, the next thing you know, it's all about The Beatles, so you just never know. But I knew they were good.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DUM DUM"")

LEE: (Singing) A-music's sweet. The lights are low, playing a song on the radio.

DETROW: You know, you had success so young, and so many people who have success so young have a harder time in life. It seems like you've lived a really fulfilling, long life. It seems like things have worked out pretty well. What do you think the trick was to navigating being so famous early on in your teen years and coming out of it seemingly pretty OK?

LEE: Well, I think that the greatest thing was nobody ever told me I was famous. I loved what I did. I loved singing. I loved the whole scope of the industry, and I just wanted to be a part of it. I didn't have to be No. 1 to be happy. And I think when you can get to that place in life, in anything that you do, you're going to be successful.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I'M SORRY"")

LEE: (Vocalizing).

DETROW: Of your other hits that people these days might not be as much familiar with, what's your favorite? What's one that we should make sure to include in this segment?

LEE: Well, you need to include ""I'm Sorry.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I'M SORRY"")

LEE: (Singing) I'm sorry, so sorry, that I was such a fool.

The early stuff 'cause that's really how I cut my teeth and learned what I was doing.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I'M SORRY"")

LEE: (Singing) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes.

I appreciate the songwriters that brought them to me. I appreciate the great A Team, the musicians, because they were like my big brothers and the Anita Kerr Singers. It's just listening to all these great guys do their thing and share their talent with me.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I'M SORRY"")

LEE: (Singing) Love was blind, and I was too blind to see. Sorry.

And it just don't get any better than that.

DETROW: Well, Brenda Lee, I've got to say I get a sentimental feeling every time I hear your song. And it was truly wonderful to talk to you. Thank you so much for joining us.

LEE: Thank you. Merry Christmas.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE"")

LEE: (Singing) You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing, let's be jolly. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Rockin' around the Christmas tree - have a happy holiday. Everyone dancing... Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."
102,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,How to do a financial reset,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2023-12-25/how-to-do-a-financial-reset,"ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Have you ever found yourself toiling away at work, feeling completely burned out and thinking, you know, what if I just quit? Could I do that? Or maybe your work situation isn't dire, but you're ready for something new. You want to try another kind of job or start your own business or move to your dream city that happens to be more expensive. Making a big move like that can often feel impractical and out of reach. And you might feel like...

JILL SCHLESINGER: How could I leave something I've invested so much into? This is called the sunk-cost effect. It's actually, like, behavioral economics. And it's actually pretty dangerous because just because you've sunk some time, energy and money into something doesn't mean that's the best thing for you to continue doing.

SHAPIRO: That's Jill Schlesinger, a business analyst at CBS news and author of the book ""The Great Money Reset."" She says if you're considering a reset, it helps to crunch the numbers, see what your finances look like, what might be possible for you and when. It's the sort of advice that could also help anyone pondering a financially ambitious New Year's resolution. Schlesinger spoke with NPR's Marielle Segarra of our Life Kit podcast and shared a framework - five steps you can follow to help make these decisions.

SCHLESINGER: I call it the Fabulous Five. So No. 1 is you calculate the resources that you have, and that means, like, what you own. Those are your assets and your income and really everything. You know, like, when I say what you own, a lot of people will say to me, well, I don't own anything. And I say, but don't you have a 401(k)? Oh, yeah, I have that. So it really is a real calculation of kind of what you have and also what you might be giving up. Imagine what it would be if you had to do it all on your own.

MARIELLE SEGARRA, BYLINE: Yeah. And then in terms of assets, you mentioned one which is like, OK, so you have a lump sum of money in the bank, or you have money in a retirement plan. What other kinds of assets might people consider in this step?

SCHLESINGER: Anything that you would want to actually sell and that would make a difference. I'm much more concerned or much more focused on what you could convert to something easily to cash. So I think it's more of your savings account. If you're in - you're like, sort of middle-aged, you have some investment property. And I think that a lot of people look at their home, and they don't actually think of it as an asset, but it is usually people's largest asset.

SEGARRA: Yeah. And it's interesting. That sort of leads us to step two because your house can be an asset, and it can also be a liability because you owe maybe a mortgage every month, right?

SCHLESINGER: Right, right. Exactly. And step two is calculate your debt and your other liabilities - yes, of course, a mortgage. Maybe it's a credit card. Maybe you didn't quite pay everything off. It could be a car loan, education loans, either for yourself or for your kids. All of those things come under this category of liabilities.

And, you know, what happens when you're looking at these things - it - don't throw in the towel in that moment, OK? That's all I want to say. Like, I think that some people say, oh, I can't do it. I have all this debt. OK, calm down. We may be able to still do something. We're just in the phase - the earliest stage of taking a good, hard look at what you have and the position you're in today.

SEGARRA: So let's move on to step three. We've been talking about housing, and that's what this step is about, right? What do you tell people to consider here?

SCHLESINGER: I think first of it - of all is if I were to sell this house right now, what would that mean? What would I - how would I feel? Would I feel unburdened? Would I feel untethered? Right? Those are two opposite poles of something, right? Would I feel like I could have more freedom to consider something else in the future? For a lot of people, selling their homes makes absolutely no sense. I think the biggest question to ask is that, you know, what is it that I'm looking to reset, and how does my housing play into that?

SEGARRA: Does this step only come into play if you own a home or it's also - what are the questions if you rent?

SCHLESINGER: The renting is, you know, have I really looked at what it means to, like, tally up the cost of where I am right now? And, you know, when rents were going crazy and a lot of people said - I hate renting; I hate that my landlord has all the power - I would really encourage you to understand that owning is also really hard and that you might have a better deal than you think. Most of the people who are renting and are considering a reset have way more freedom to reset than those who own.

SEGARRA: I feel like we've been talking about expenses here when we talk about rent, and that is step four - right? - to consider your spending habits and what you have to spend.

SCHLESINGER: Yeah. This is one of those strange steps that you have to take regardless of how much money you have. I'm really, really stressing that this is not about living like a monk. This is just accounting for what your needs are and then what you actually are spending your money on. So if you're on this, like, track where you've been spending a lot of money and you say - well, you know what, I'm going to leave corporate America and be a teacher - and you think your whole family is going to reset to a lower spending, you have to be sober about that analysis. Maybe they will, but it is a lot of hard work to get there.

SEGARRA: Yeah. So what's step five?

SCHLESINGER: So this is a little bit more of the emotional part. Step five is consider the obligations that you might have to others. And so it's very hard to have these conversations. So have you made an obligation to your siblings that, you know, well, I make a bunch of money and you know, I'll take on the care of Mom? Do you have a sibling who's likely to need help down the line? Yeah, you just want to know about that. And so when you consider those obligations, as you're looking at your own reset, you know, that could actually have a real impact for you.

SEGARRA: Coming out of the five steps, you have all these numbers written down and all these factors. What do you do with them? Like, what questions do you need to be asking yourself once you know these things?

SCHLESINGER: So the first five steps are to figure out where you are today. And then the scenarios that you build out are, for maybe the first, say, one, two, three years, to say, what happens to these five things in a year from now if this is the best case, if it's a middle case and if it's the worst case?

The victim is believed to be a 10-year-old resident of the home. Five other family members lived in the home, including four adults and a 13-year-old.

Authorities responded around 7:30 a.m. to a reported dwelling fire at 317 Willow Drive. Upon arrival, firefighters found the family standing outside their home, stating a young girl was still inside.

Firefighters entered the home and located the child. However, she was later pronounced deceased on the scene. The fire was upgraded to two alarms, bringing nearly 75 firefighters to the scene. It took almost one hour to control the fire.



The fire's origin and cause remain under investigation, and investigators have been unable to locate working smoke alarms in the home.

Six people were displaced from the home at 319 Willow Drive due to the fire and are being assisted by the American Red Cross.

According to Montgomery Fire Wire, it seems that the fireworks may have caused a small brush fire at Garland Avenue and Piney branch road.

She asked 7News to conceal her identity for safety reasons since she arrived from Venezuela to seek asylum in America.

But with her child in her arms, she detailed how she got to Washington, D.C., and why she fears she may have to live on the streets with her family.

This story began with hope.

""I tried to go to the United States like so many others for stability and a future for not only myself, but most importantly my baby,"" the mother of one told 7News.

From Venezuela, she ventured to Peru before making her way to Georgia.

There, she had difficulties finding a place to stay, before being faced with the same challenges in the nation's capital.

""When I first came to the United States, I went to Atlanta and I was there for a short time, but things were very difficult with the situation with jobs and with refuge. I heard I could get help with shelter and with my baby here in Washington. So I asked the people at the shelter in Atlanta, and they said they would help me with the tickets here to Washington,"" the woman told 7News. ""We stayed [at the temporary shelter in D.C.] for three days, and after three days they said we couldn't stay anymore.""

That D.C. temporary shelter, she said, was at the welcome center instead of a longer-term shelter.

MORE |

Other than the short stay, she told 7News she could not even get some of the bare necessities for her family.

""When we got to the shelter, they only gave us three days of shelter. I asked for things like food. Every single time I would ask for food or other support for my baby, they would give me some different response. They only gave me and my husband, and my baby, two cots to sleep on. My baby had a really hard time sleeping because she sleeps on her back and with two cots she was sleeping on my body, and there wasn't enough room for her,"" the woman said.

This mother and her family were able to stay with a volunteer after being pushed out of the city's temporary shelter.

However, she has to leave there Tuesday, the day after Christmas. Now, she is left trying to figure out how to keep her family off the streets, instead of celebrating and getting gifts for her child.

""She doesn't have any gifts to open. We don't have a stable place to celebrate Christmas as a family. Not only is it difficult, but it's really sad - not just for me, but for so many families,"" the woman said.



Amy Fischer with the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has been helping migrants arriving in D.C., and told 7News the city is simply not utilizing resources that should be made available to migrants.

MORE |

""There's plenty of space in the migrant shelters. The D.C. government stopped admitting families into the longer-term shelters. What we have now is an incredible amount of space in the migrant shelters that is going unfilled while migrant families are sleeping in the streets,"" Fischer said. ""We know there are hotel rooms that are being intended to provide shelter for migrants that are sitting empty while the D.C. government continues to make this choice to put families on the street.""



on D.C. Department of Human Services - or DHS, which runs the two migrant shelters in the city - running out of space and having to turn people away.

That report came as Texas and other border states bused migrants to northern sanctuary cities.

Earlier this week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced on X he had . That same day, he also posted on X he had sent including that arrived on .

7News On Your Side reached out again to DHS, asking them the following questions:

What capacity levels are migrant shelters currently at? Is the city still not able to house additional migrants? How many total migrants has the city housed? Will the city open more shelters? What more can the city do to help these migrants?

A spokesperson said the agency could not comment on whether or not the two migrant shelters still have room, but provided the following statistics:

# of migrant families in temporary accommodations: 297 total families sheltered between Harbor Light Respite and Temporary Lodging Facilities.

# of families served to-date: 760 families have been served at both Harbor Light Respite and Temporary Lodging Facilities, inclusive of current and departed families.

# of migrants arriving, on average, per week and/or month: An average of 712 Migrants have arrived per month since October 2022.

total program costs, to-date: $51.9M invoiced through September 2023.

7News On Your Side again asked about shelter space. A spokesperson said, ""Migrant families are still able to access services and resources.""

However, Fischer said she has been on the phone with these shelters and learned shelter space is not being used up.

""When people are arriving to the District, we're helping them go to the welcome center and explaining the government is only typically providing three-to-five days of shelter for families. We're doing our best we can to provide other options,"" Fischer said. ""If there are community members with a spare bedroom or space in their house, we try and fill it with families, but the reality of the matter is there is a growing population of unhoused migrant families that are sleeping in parks, sleeping in streets, sleeping in tents across the city.""



This is leaving migrants like the mother who spoke with 7News in limbo.

""After I was out of the city shelter, a volunteer helped me find a place to stay at a house with a volunteer, but I'm only able to stay there until Tuesday. In reality, I don't know what's going to happen after Tuesday,"" the woman said.

Fischer also said the time of year and drop in temperatures makes this practice even more dangerous.

""As we are in hypothermia season, it is just increasing the cruelty. It is one thing for a family with small children to sleep on the streets. That is something that is unacceptable 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. When it is cold outside, when it is freezing outside, and people don't have anywhere to go, it increases the danger,"" Fischer said.



In the meantime, the mother told 7News she is urging D.C.'s government to do more to help families going through the same situation she is.

""Sometimes I even think about going back to my country because the situation here is so difficult,"" the woman said. ""They didn't understand the journey that we took to get here. They don't understand. The government should do more to help the babies. Three days is not enough time to find shelter. Three days is not enough to find somewhere to rent and to live. They should give us more time. There are so many families that are sleeping on the streets. I just wish for the government, especially for the children, could offer more time and shelter, and see things from our perspective of trying to care for our children."""

For one Maryland woman, they are coming true thanks to her daughter.

""Well, I have always wanted to be a nurse,"" said Carrie Rodevick.



Although her caring and empathetic spirit would lend to a pleasant bedside manner, life had other plans. She works at Luminis Health Anne Arundel Medical Center in corporate compliance.

“So, I’m actually on the other side of things where the bills go out,"" she explained.

An important job with supportive colleagues, but not her true calling.

“I wish I was that person over there taking care of that patient,"" she told 7News Health and Wellness Reporter Victoria Sanchez.



Like for so many of us, life happened. Carrie got married, had two children, and soon became the breadwinner of the family. Her dream of becoming a nurse would stay just that, a dream. Or so she thought.



“And then with my little catalyst over here who’s like, ‘Just do it, mom.’”



Carrie's catalyst is her 21-year-old daughter, Rachel Gwin.

“My whole life, ever since, I feel like the first time I remember her saying it, I was 5 years old, is her saying, ‘I wish I was a nurse,'"" she said.

Rachel is a student at Anne Arundel Community College located just outside Annapolis, Maryland.

""I knew I had to go to her and be like, ‘Mom, you have to come back, you have to come to school. AACC is the perfect place to do it. Come back with me, we’ll study together, we’ll take on the load together.’ I didn’t want to leave her behind. I couldn’t leave my mom behind,"" Rachel told Sanchez.



After some convincing, Carrie joined her daughter. The mother-daughter duo now nursing students together.

“You have a built-in study buddy!” Sanchez said.



“Yup, right at home!” said Rachel.

“And we’re still getting along,"" commented Carrie.

“I just go to her door and knock and go, ‘Hey, mom. Could you come and explain this part of the chapter for me?’"" Rachel added with a laugh.

After a couple of detours in her own education journey, Rachel is a dean's list student.

“I remember thinking, ‘Oh, OK. I can do it. Just because I dropped out of high school, it doesn’t mean anything. It just means that I took a different path.”



And that new path includes her mom who is fulfilling a decades-old dream.

“When I look back, graduating from community college, I want to be able to look at the picture and it’s not just me standing there, I want it to be me and my mom standing there both getting our diplomas,"" Rachel said.



The pair plan on getting their registered nurse degree in the fall of 2025."

“We cannot say ‘sorry’ to the people in need,” he said. ‘“We are out of budget, we cannot feed.' We have to struggle, we have to do whatever we need to do.”

Gebregziabher said the nonprofit dipped about four months into the 2024 budget to help make up the difference. He is hoping for more community donations and grant funding to keep up with operating costs.

“The officials, they do not see it,” Gebregziabher said. “We see it day in and day out, this is a big problem.”

In 2017, 27% of Maryland residents were affected by hunger or food insecurity, compared to 33% in 2021 and 2022, .

Food insecurity in the area has increased since the pandemic began, leading to Shepherd’s Table consistently serving more people, Gebregziabher told 7News.

Retired volunteer firefighter Ken Beyer is the founder and CEO of Harbor of Grace Enhanced Recovery Center.

“I just saw how sick, mentally ill a lot of first responders are that suffer from addiction, depression, anxiety, and they don’t get any help, the right kind of help,” he said.

Ken was once one of them.

Now sober himself, Harbor of Grace was a place he knew so many first responders could benefit from.

“They’re a very difficult population, very private. They’re guarded. They don’t trust anybody,” he said.

It’s a place where first responders struggling with mental health and addiction problems can come and let their guard down.

“We’ve seen in the last 3-4 years an increase in anxiety, depression, other process addictions, substance abuse, sleep disorders. They’re sicker and more mentally ill today than they were years ago,” he said.

Addiction brought Robert Quick, a retired Baltimore Police officer, to Harbor of Grace.

“For 26 years, I buried subordinates and coworkers from line of duty deaths and seen friends get injured on the job - handful of lawsuits - high profile incidents - was involved in a police-involved shooting - a lot of trauma, a lot that occurred in that period of time,” he said.

Quick was found to be under the influence at work, and that’s when he knew it was time to get help.

“What started as a socially drinking became more and more dependent on alcohol as my therapy or coping mechanism, I think, for what I’d seen on the job,” he said. “I never drank on the job. I never drank before the job, but was still at an intoxicated level from drinking the night before many hours later while on duty and I had no idea that was the case and where I was.”

When checking in at the recovery center patients first go through a medical and psychiatric assessment and spend a few days in the medical wing.

“We look at everything medically, psychiatrically, we look at their home life, we look at, what does their recovery look like when they leave here. Is there a good family support system in place? Departmental support in place? We look at everything here and assign them to the right therapist who will be able to help them with their particular needs,” said Beyer.

They’re encouraged to face their demons.

“Coming here and getting to work with a counselor to unpack that, getting the educational piece around trauma and stress and triggers really opened my eyes and allowed me to start dealing with things in a healthy and productive way as opposed to turning to a substance to numb myself,” said Quick.

They offer more than addiction treatment.

Often, it’s officer-involved shootings and other traumatic on-the-job experiences that bring first responders in.

For retired Baltimore Police Officer Robert Brown, one day on the job changed everything.

“I kept thinking about it. I just kept thinking about what I could’ve done better. Everything you could imagine I thought about it,” he said.

He spent a week in recovery along a community of other officers who just got it.

“He took me into the roll call room where they were having a meeting, and it was 16 guys, and one of the guys, who is a great friend now who works up in the northeast he looked into my eyes and said there’s nothing there, no life. He goes I’ve been there. I’ve done that. He goes you need to be here, so I came,” he said.

With inpatient and outpatient care and a 24-hour mobile response team, the recovery center has helped officers from all 50 states and served 700 agencies nationwide.

It’s had such an impact on Brown and Quick that now they’re both full-time employees at Harbor of Grace.

“I love watching guys come in beat down and just seeing them and bringing life back into them. To watch them smile, giggle, laugh, and cut up with everybody else. It just makes you feel good,” said Brown."
