0,Statement from Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on U.S. Strikes in Iraq,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/statements-remarks/secretary,"Today, at President Biden's direction, U.S. military forces conducted necessary and proportionate strikes on three facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups in Iraq. These precision strikes are a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias, including an attack by Iran-affiliated Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups on Erbil Air Base earlier today, and intended to disrupt and degrade capabilities of the Iran-aligned militia groups directly responsible.Today’s attack led to three injuries to U.S. personnel, leaving one service member in critical condition. My prayers are with the brave Americans who were injured today.And let me be clear – the President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests. There is no higher priority. While we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities."
1,Live Whole Health #201: Time to set your New Year’s Intention,https://news.va.gov/127420/live-whole-health-201-your-new-years-intention/,"Well, here we are — another year. Another chance to think about what really matters in your life. This year, instead of resolutions, how about setting intentions? We know what they say about “good intentions,” but without them, we may end up living out the same patterns year after year.

Intentions come from the heart and can reconnect you to your true mission, aspiration and purpose (MAP). Intentions are different from a specific goal or resolution, but an intention can help us achieve our goals. For example, you may consider setting an intention to live a healthier lifestyle versus a resolution to go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Living a healthier lifestyle may include working out, but it may also include weeks where you don’t make it to the gym all three days. Maybe those weeks you focus on getting quality sleep, eating healthy meals, increasing the amount of water you drink, and decreasing your screen time.

Before setting your intentions for the year, take a few minutes to answer two questions, either by writing them down or just thinking about them in your mind. There is no right or wrong answers for these questions and the answers to both may be similar:

What really matters to you in your life?

What brings you a sense of joy and happiness?

When you are ready, setting your paper aside if you were writing down your answers, practice this short 5-minute meditation to help you set your intentions for 2024.

Do your 2024 intentions include making changes related to your health and well-being?

2,Dublin VA hosts resource fair,https://news.va.gov/126933/dublin-va-hosts-resource-fair/,"Helping Veterans stay in a home-like environment as long as possible often contributes directly to their health, happiness and quality of life.

Knowing this motivated Dublin VA’s Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) staff to sponsor an informational resource fair in the medical center auditorium.

Themed “There’s no place like home” after the “Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” the fair included multiple informational booths staffed by VA employees and community partners. Refreshments were available and HBPC staff appeared in costume. A yellow brick road led attendees into the venue.

HBPC nurse manager Kristie Martin was pleased with the event’s success. “We provided information to over 150 participants and received three potential referrals for home-based care during the event,” Martin said. “Our feeling was that one of the best ways to get this important information out was to make it fun, so our team decided the Wizard of Oz was the perfect way to do it.”

“Our folks are so committed to their Veterans.”

Martin said the event was so well-received that her team plans to host it annually at the medical center and take the show on the road to their community clinics around their 49-county service area. She credited the HBPC team with the events success.

“Our folks are all so committed to their Veterans that the real challenge was deciding which to pick from all the wonderful ideas they came up with. We have a lot of other possibilities for the future,” she added.

The HBPC program is for Veterans who need team-based in-home support for ongoing diseases and illnesses that affect their health and daily activities and who live within fifty miles of a VA medical facility. Many such Veterans usually have difficulty making and keeping clinic visits because of the severity of their illness and are often homebound.

The program is also for Veterans who are isolated and for caregivers experiencing excessive burden caring for their Veteran. HBPC can be used in combination with other Home and Community Based Services. The program began at Dublin VA in 2006."
3,American soldiers on Christmas Day,https://news.va.gov/126885/american-soldiers-on-christmas-day/,"It’s Christmas. We hope you are enjoying time with your friends and family.

As most Veterans can remember, there were some Christmases in their careers when they were not able to be home. Wearing the uniform meant a day of duty and sacrifice.

For many, it was a quiet day of reflection and camaraderie.

Throughout our history, though, there have been significant military activities on Christmas day.

The most famous was Washington’s crossing of the Delaware.

In the winter of 1776, Gen. George Washington wanted to restore faith in the battle for independence. He knew after Christmas celebrations the Hessians—troops hired by the British—would be groggy and not ready for a fight.

On Christmas night, Washington and his troops boarded boats and rowed across the Delaware River. His 2,400 soldiers surprised the enemy who surrendered in an hour.

The Battle of Trenton renewed the hope of a young America.

World War I Christmas truce

After months of the First World War, soldiers were not looking forward to spending Christmas away from their families. But something amazing happened on Dec. 24, 1914. Soldiers on both sides put down their guns and walked out of their trenches. For a few hours, there was peace.

The truce was brightened by the arrival of miniature Christmas trees on the German side. Soldiers called out from both sides with requests not to fire. Some were laughing, joking and exchanging gifts.

“Stars and Stripes Forever” is written

Not a military battle but an important part of America’s military traditions.

John Philip Sousa was the director of the Marine band. On Christmas Day 1896, while crossing the Atlantic, he had the idea for the melody of his most famous song. The tune for “Stars and Stripes Forever” was from memories of his time as the Marine band’s leader.

The Battle of the Bulge

A Christmas in 1944 marks one of the most heroic battles in miliary history. The soldiers defending Bastogne spent their Christmas on the battlefield.

The Battle of the Bulge lasted six weeks, including the Siege of Bastogne from Dec. 20-27. German battalions were ready to annihilate the troops in Bastogne and a German general gave them two hours to surrender.

Brigadier General Anthony C. McAuliffe famously replied: “Nuts!” The Americans were rescued and celebrated another belated Christmas.

Merry Christmas from VA!"
4,How to Maximize Texas' Relationship with our No. 1 Trade Partner,https://www.txbiz.org/post/how-to-maximize-texas-relationship-with-our-no-1-trade-partner,"The global economy is a complex, dynamic and interconnected space, and if a nation or state wants to ensure a robust economy, the importance of healthy trade partnerships cannot be overstated. At the Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference, a primary focus of discussion was the immense value Texas’ current trade partnership with Mexico holds.

Gerry Schwebel, the Executive Vice President of the International Bank of Commerce, shared insights on the unprecedented growth that has been occurring recently throughout the Lone Star State, particularly in Central Texas. His perspective highlighted the strategic significance of the I-35 corridor, stretching from Texas into Mexico, as a thriving trade bloc. He also emphasized the need to analyze the substantial investments pouring into the region and continue to utilize and expand the opportunities they offer.

“With that (growth) comes jobs, it comes tier one, tier two, tier three suppliers,” Schwebel said. “It just creates an environment that is enviable, and we have it. So, as we move forward as a State Chamber, I would like to make sure that every part of the state, particularly rural Texas, gets the opportunity to participate.”













Texas shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to attracting new businesses and experiencing diverse industry growth. Rolando Pablos, the former Texas Secretary of State, stressed the necessity of preparing for this surge through strategic investments and fortifying trade routes.

""We expect a tsunami of more business to come, and we have to get ready to get ready for that through infrastructure and a business-friendly climate and through trade routes,” he said. “You know, bilateral or state and Mexico level relationships.""

In the broader context, the significance of Texas and Mexico as trade partners cannot be overblown. The economic development fostered by this collaboration not only supercharges prosperity and security but also creates an environment of unparalleled potential. The partnership with Mexico is also a linchpin in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and has resulted in innumerable benefits for Texas, highlighting the interdependence and mutual success that such alliances can yield.

However, recent challenges, such as the temporary suspension of international rail crossings at Eagle Pass and El Paso, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of these connections. The closures, affecting a substantial portion of cross-border rail traffic, underline the urgent need to reopen these routes to safeguard commerce and prevent further damage to the economy."
5,A Bright Future for Semiconductors in Texas,https://www.txbiz.org/post/a-bright-future-for-semiconductors-in-texas,"In Texas, the growing semiconductor industry exists as a display of our state’s economic strength, technological innovation and commitment to national security. The Texas Association of Business’ 2023 Policy Conference brought to light the profound importance of continuing to bolster this industry, with key insights from influential speakers emphasizing the critical role semiconductors play in shaping Texas’ future.

Adriana Cruz, the Executive Director of Texas Economic Development & Tourism, affirmed the significance of the semiconductor industry, stating, ""Texas is truly the birthplace of the integrated circuit, and the semiconductor industry for our state is incredibly important… there are 15 semiconductor manufacturers in the state right now… 43,000 Texans are employed by the semiconductor industry.”













It is evident that this industry is a catalyst for job creation and overall economic prosperity. Strengthening this sector promises to further boost employment opportunities as Texas’ population continues to grow, which would lead to an even more successful economy.

Although our state is traditionally associated with industries such as oil and gas, investing in developing sectors, specifically semiconductors, would make Texas more resilient to economic fluctuations and global market shifts. Recent disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain as seen during the pandemic underscore the importance of strengthening Texas' semiconductor industry to ensure a resilient and robust supply chain, reducing dependency on foreign sources.













The speakers also underlined the national security implications intertwined with the semiconductor industry. This industry plays a pivotal role in various national defense systems, communication networks and critical infrastructure, further emphasizing the need for a reliable domestic supply. With an environment already primed for an increase in semiconductor manufacturing, Texas has an opportunity to take the stage as a national and global leader in an industry that is fully integrated and essential to citizens’ daily lives."
6,Businesses Urge CBP to Resume Rail Operations at Eagle Pass and El Paso,https://www.txbiz.org/post/businesses-urge-cbp-to-resume-rail-operations-at-eagle-pass-and-el-paso,"Austin, TX – The Texas Association of Business (TAB) President and CEO, Glenn Hamer, released the following statement in response to railway crossing closures issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection:





“This is a short-sighted, half-baked decision that will not make a dent in illegal migration but will cause economic harm to everyday Americans. On behalf of the business community, TAB urges CBP to reopen railway crossing operations at El Paso and Eagle Pass to resume the flow of legal, everyday goods to American citizens.”





TAB sent a letter to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the Texas delegation, recognizing the importance of a secure border and underscoring the economic case for resuming rail operations.





﻿ Eagle Pass and El Paso are the No. 2 and No. 3 rail gateways, moving roughly 450,000 rail shipments annually. Nearly 10,000 railcars in Mexico and the U.S. are being held from one day's closure alone. Eagle Pass and El Paso account for a total of $33.95 billion or 35.8% of all cross-border rail traffic to/from Mexico in the most recent 12 months of available US DOT transborder data. A wide diversity of industries such as food/beverage, finished vehicles and auto parts, agriculture, grain, consumer goods, and other industrial products will be heavily impacted.

TAB is the Texas State Chamber, representing companies of every size and industry. The Association's purpose is to champion the best business climate in the world, unleashing the power of free enterprise to enhance lives for generations. Follow TAB on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn .
