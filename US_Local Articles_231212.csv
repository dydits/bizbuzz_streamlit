Michael Antonio Cobb Jr. allegedly fired multiple shots at residents in a home on Lakeview Street in the Experiment area just outside Griffin, according to the state agency. It was just before midnight when deputies were called, and they saw Cobb running away when they arrived.

Cobb eventually returned to the scene, and “during the incident, a deputy fired at Cobb and hit Cobb,” the GBI said. It was not clear what caused deputies to fire shots. No law enforcement officers were injured."

As work on the concrete pads begins, it’s yet to be seen how the new electric air taxi industry that Archer envisions may develop, and how that could transform the town of Covington with a population of about 15,000.

Still, state and local officials have offered millions of dollars in tax incentives to Archer for the project — including a $3 million grant for machinery and equipment, contingent on job creation. Plans are underway to train people to work in the factory building a new generation of aircraft.

Choosing Georgia

The decision to choose Covington over 28 other sites in consideration around the country was led by Archer vice president of manufacturing Glen Burks, who spent some time in Marietta and Atlanta while in the Marine Corps.

But it was a particular mix of political, geographic and economic factors that made the Covington site attractive enough to seal the deal. He recalled meeting with Newton County Industrial Development Authority officials two years ago during the site selection process.

“The very first time we sat down on August 2021 in Covington and met them for the first time, they were so excited about Archer,” Burks said during remarks at an Atlanta Aero Club luncheon in September.

Other developments — including a planned Rivian electric vehicle plant to be built farther down I-20 — encountered fierce resistance from local residents and some local officials.

Burks said the cooperation he saw from officials in Covington “makes it to where you can solve anything.”

Georgia and local officials are hungry for projects like Archer, which they code-named Project Jane early on. The state and Gov. Brian Kemp “have identified e-mobility as a critical industry to Georgia’s future,” according to Georgia Department of Economic Development global commerce division director Bob Kosek. “Georgia is creating the jobs of tomorrow, building on our existing industries, including aerospace.”

Kosek called Archer “a natural fit for the community’s tech ecosystem, which includes Meta, Rivian, and Takeda.”

Covington ended up as one of three finalists for the Archer Aviation site, along with Tucson, Arizona, and the Alliance Airport in Fort Worth, Texas.

Burks said the elements that made Covington attractive included the location on an airport, affordability and the town’s growth aspirations.

With plans to hire hundreds of hourly workers for the factory, Burks prioritized a low cost of living — a lesson he learned after seeing hourly workers struggle with a high housing costs in Maryland at a previous job.

Having a community with housing “at a price point they could afford — whether that’s apartment living, townhomes, single family homes... that’s certainly important to me,” Burks said.

And he said that over a series of visits to Covington over the last couple of years, he has seen the town grow.

Certification flight path

Archer’s most important goal is working toward certification of its Midnight aircraft in the new electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) category, a process that is expected to stretch into 2025.

Archer aims to get a production certificate to open the Covington facility in the middle of next year and begin building aircraft on an assembly line.

Getting new aircraft certified takes years even under good circumstances, and the task of getting Federal Aviation Administration approval for eVTOLs that could change how people fly is even more daunting.

Still, Archer is already putting the pieces in place to prepare for the Covington site, including hiring some employees to start working at its San Jose facility. The first six to eight aircraft are being produced at San Jose for testing and those employees will move to Covington when the new plant opens. They’re being trained with a three-week curriculum developed in partnership with Georgia Piedmont Technical College.

Building a workforce

In the first few years, Archer plans to ramp up to a few hundred workers at the Covington facility, according to Tosha Perkins, Archer’s chief people officer. That is expected to grow to about 650 workers come 2027, and as many as 1,500 workers by 2030.

To do that, the company plans to help develop a certificate program at Georgia Piedmont Technical College to train an eVTOL manufacturing workforce, and use the state’s workforce development program Georgia Quick Start.

Perkins said she doesn’t plan to list the job openings until sometime in the first half of next year when the company is confident that it will get the production certificate around June.

She knows attracting people to Covington to work in an entirely new industry won’t necessarily be easy.

“Covington itself is a very small town,” Perkins said. So it will be important that the community continues to add enough housing for hundreds more workers and that the area is alluring enough to draw people willing to move there and raise a family. “It’s just not yet built up in a way where we could do that today,” she said."

The average high for this time of year is 57 degrees.

“At least we are going to see lots of sunshine after a dreary, wet end to the weekend,” Deon said. “As we go through the day today, still a little bit breezy, so we’ll have to deal with that.”

Wind gusts could reach up to about 20 to 25 mph until about 3 p.m. when they start to ease up.

By this evening, we’re in for another cooldown, with some areas reaching the 30s as soon as the sun sets, Deon said.

It’ll be another cold night tonight, but the high tomorrow should reach a slightly more seasonable range in the low to mid 50s.

Jones’ turbulent final months with her mom highlight an experience many caregivers in the United States face when their loved ones are diagnosed with dementia: one marked with frustration, isolation and fear of what’s next. The state is making strides to improve care for Georgians with dementia, and has poured funds into efforts focused on diagnosing people earlier, with the hope of slowing the disease’s progression. And there are signs of real progress: the state has opened clinics across the state to diagnose people with dementia, and hopes to start administering Alzheimer’s drugs that are coming onto the market.

But significant challenges remain. Dementia care is costly, and there’s currently a dearth of health care workers, as well as few specialists that focus on dementia.

In Jones’ case, her calls for help went unanswered.

She called the police who threatened to arrest her mom for wandering the neighborhood. She called a crisis hotline for Georgians and was told her mom didn’t qualify for help. She tried getting her mom on Medicaid, to no avail.

“Mom, she constantly struggles, and right now is slipping through the cracks,” Jones said in the interview shortly before her mom’s death.

Access to dementia expertise is a problem across the United States. National reports have shown that only a small portion of older people are being properly screened for the symptoms of memory loss. There are also issues around the public’s basic understanding of dementia.

Dr. Jim Lah, associate professor for the Department of Neurology in the Emory University School of Medicine, said dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are terms that are often used interchangeably, but that dementia refers to any condition that causes a deterioration in a person’s thinking abilities. This includes Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common form of dementia, as well as vascular dementia and strokes, among other health issues.

According to Lah, there are only a handful of neurologists in the state of Georgia who have specialty expertise in dementia, most of whom are at the Emory Integrated Memory Care Clinic. This means primary care doctors are often responsible for diagnosing patients with dementia.

“There’s no way that we can meet the demand,” Lah said of Emory’s clinic. “And so eventually we wind up booking out, booking out, and several times we’ve booked out so far that our scheduling system — which only goes 13 months — was now full. Access has been a real big problem.”

Other barriers to access include the cost — Medicaid doesn’t cover some of the more intensive services — and a lack of places providing services, according to Nancy Pitra, director of government affairs for the Alzheimer’s Association, Georgia Chapter. During the pandemic, many health care workers left their low paying, high stress jobs for better positions, resulting in a health care workforce crisis.

“What we do know is that we do need more providers, there’s a workforce shortage out there,” Pitra said.

In 2017, the state Legislature set aside funds for a statewide program that makes it easier for Georgians to find a location where they can be evaluated for signs of dementia. The program, Georgia Memory Net, is a partnership between the state and Emory that trains physicians on screening for dementia, and collects data the state can use to support those living with the disease. The program, which started opening clinics in 2018, also provides support for patients and families who are coping with dementia.

Under this program, experts in Emory’s Cognitive Neurology Program train and work alongside “Memory Assessment Clinics” that have been set up across the state in Atlanta, Augusta, Macon, Albany, Savannah, Vidalia, and Gainesville. There are now also expanded options for telehealth appointments. As of this year, DHS now has a dementia care specialist at each Area Agency on Aging around the state.

Kylie Winton, a spokesperson with the state’s Department of Human Services, said that the program has provided services for more than 2,748 patients and conducted over 5,084 patient visits to date.

There are other reasons for optimism: drugs that could help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease are now coming onto the market, and there’s evidence these drugs could help, particularly if Alzheimer’s is identified in its early stages. Lah, who also serves as the director of the Georgia Memory Net, said that Emory is working with the clinics to start administering these drugs, but doing so will take some time.

Other states have begun turning to Georgia for advice on how to get their state governments to invest in similar programs, he said.

“We still have got a lot of work to do, but Georgia is actually well ahead,” Lah said. “I would argue that we have put together the most effective statewide program anywhere in the country.”

The Alzheimer’s Association has a free helpline that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Specialists and master’s-level clinicians can offer confidential support and information to people living with dementia, caregivers, and their loved ones. The phone number is (800) 272-3900."
6,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,"49ers: Deebo Samuel, Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey top Seahawks again",https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/49ers-studs-and-duds-deebo-samuel-christian-mccaffrey-lead-the-way-in-fifth-straight-win-over-the-seahawks/,"SANTA CLARA — Another week, another win for the 49ers, who are cruising to another NFC West title and, perhaps, the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.

While Sunday’s performance was hardly the Niners’ best of the year, the 28-16 win over division rival Seattle — their fifth-straight — was still plenty good.

San Francisco now sits four games up on the Seahawks and Rams in the NFC West. On Monday, they can clinch a playoff berth with a Packers loss or tie.

The machine keeps rolling.

Here were the folks who made it happen — and a couple of folks who jammed up the gears:

STUDS 💪

Christian McCaffrey

» The 49ers’ running back took a toss left, cut back inside the left guard, and ran 72 yards on the game’s first play.

And while his rightful touchdown was vultured by Jordan Mason, the result is undeniable: This guy is so flippin’ good it’s borderline unfair.

Deebo Samuel

» It’s not all catch-and-run with the do-it-all offensive weapon. No, his 54-yard touchdown catch was him running past the Seahawks’ coverage and then catching it.

He added a third-quarter touchdown on an end-around run at the 1-yard line.

There isn’t an offensive player in the game on Samuel’s level right now.

In turn, the Niners look unbeatable: San Francisco is now 10-0 this season when Samuel plays more than 10 snaps in a game. They’re 18-1 in the last 19 games with him in the lineup. We all know that loss.

Brock Purdy

» It wasn’t Purdy’s best game, but you’d never know with the numbers he put on the stat sheet.

Some money throws brought about a 368-yard passing day — a new career high.

It was also an efficient enough day to put him in some outstanding company in NFL history.

It was Purdy’s seventh straight game completing at least 70 percent of his passes. That’s second-best in NFL history, one shy of Joe Montana, who went for eight straight in 1989.

It was also his 12th career game with a 110-plus quarterback rating. Of all quarterbacks in NFL history, only Russell Wilson and Justin Herbert have posted more such games in the first two seasons. Purdy tied his childhood idol, Dan Marino, with 12.

Ji’Ayir Brown

» He’s a kid still figuring out how to play the second-most challenging position in football — safety — but he is making big plays, and it’s not by accident. Sunday was an up-and-down game, but his early fourth-quarter interception was outstanding — one of several great plays he made.

The Niners lost an All-Pro safety, and the defense might be better for it — wild stuff.

Nick Bosa and Chase Young

The Niners rotate their defensive linemen, but there are two top options: Bosa — who has been otherworldly since the Niners’ Week 9 bye — and Young, who plays off No. 97 the way only someone with a deep history and similar football upbringing can.

(I should note that Clelin Ferrell and Javon Kinlaw had nice games, too.)

DUDS 👎

Isaiah Oliver and Ambry Thomas

» The 49ers have put a lot of effort into keeping Oliver off the field in recent weeks.

The same is true with Thomas, who only comes into games in nickel and dime situations.

But when Charvarius Ward picked up a groin injury on the game’s first drive, the Niners had little choice but to put Oliver back in at nickelback, with Deommodore Lenoir sliding outside, paired with Thomas, who was a constant on the field.

And once that happened, Seahawks backup quarterback Drew Lock started to look pretty good.

The Seahawks’ best position is wide receiver. Sunday, the 49ers looked weak at cornerback. It was the main reason this was a game.

Randy Gregory

» The next edge that Gregory sets will be the first one.

It seems as if every run to the right — Gregory’s side — results in the Niners’ defensive end on the ground near the runner, but not close enough to tackle him.

The mid-season pickup is a free agent at the end of the season. He’s going for the highlight play. When you do that on the defensive line, you end up with lowlights.

He did have a nice sack in garbage time, though.

Ronnie Bell

» The second-best play of the game — Mitch Wishnowsky’s 30-yard fake punt run — was wiped away by a low block on Bell, even though the Niners’ punter had already gained the first down.

The mistake cost the Niners a possession in a one-score game. It can’t happen."

Granato, 59, wrote on his account on X/Twitter, that he would be taking a temporary leave of absence from being a part of Chicago Blackhawks broadcasts on NBC Sports Chicago, as well as the NHL Network, to begin his treatment.

“I wish I could reach out to everyone individually, but felt like this was the best way to share the news,” Granato wrote. “My family, faith, and friends will be my strength to help me through my treatments. I appreciate all the love and support I have received already.

“With the holiday season here, cherish the times with your loved ones, as I know I will.”

Granato played 773 games over a 13-year NHL career that began in 1988 with the New York Rangers and ended in 2001 with the Sharks. Starting in 1996, Granato spent the final five years of his career in San Jose and had 99 points in 278 games.

In 1997 with the Sharks, Granato, a member of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, won the Masterton Trophy, an award that goes to the NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey.

When he was with the Los Angeles Kings, Granato required brain surgery in Feb. 1996, as blood vessels needed to be removed from his head following an on-ice collision with Hartford’s Jeff Brown.

Granato recovered and signed a contract with the Sharks as a free agent in August of that year and had 40 points in 76 games and also played in the NHL All-Star Game in San Jose that year.

Granato spent his first year-plus in the NHL with the Rangers before he was traded to the Kings in Jan. 1990. His greatest individual success as a player came In Los Angeles, as he 305 points in 380 games.

Granato. dismissed as the University of Wisconsin’s men’s hockey coach in March, began work as a studio analyst for NBC Sports Chicago during Blackhawks games earlier this season.

After his playing career, Granato worked as a coach for various NHL teams and for USA Hockey.

Granato was on the Colorado Avalanche’s coaching staff for six seasons, including nearly three years as the team’s head coach from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2008-09. In 215 games as Colorado’s head coach, Granato also was an assistant coach with Colorado during part of the 2002-03 season and from 2005-08.

Granato then joined the Pittsburgh Penguins’ coaching staff as an assistant from 2009-2014, and was an assistant for Team USA at the 2014 Olympics, before he became the head coach for the 2018 American Olympic team.

Per the American Cancer Society, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a cancer that “starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the body’s immune system.” The disease usually starts in lymph nodes or other lymph tissue, but it can sometimes affect the skin."
8,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,The Golden Globe nominations are being announce. Here’s everything you need to know,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/10/barbie-leads-golden-globe-nominations-followed-closely-by-oppenheimer/,"By LINDSEY BAHR (AP Film Writer)

Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” dominated the Golden Globe Awards nominations with nine nods for the blockbuster film, including best picture musical or comedy as well as acting nominations for Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and three of its original songs.

It was closely followed by its release date and meme companion “Oppenheimer,” which scored eight nominations, including best picture drama and for actors Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.

The revamped group, now a for-profit endeavor with a larger and more diverse voting body, announced nominations Monday for its January awards show, after scandal and several troubled years. Cedric the Entertainer and Wilmer Valderrama presided over the announcements from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the show will also take place on Jan. 7.

Here are a selection of other nominees:

Best drama movie: “Anatomy of a Fall”; “Killers of the Flower Moon”; “Maestro”; “Oppenheimer”; “Past Lives”; “The Zone of Interest.”

Animated film: “The Boy and the Heron”; “Elemental”; “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”; “The Super Mario Bros. Movie”; “Suzume”; “Wish.”

Best actor in a television drama: Brian Cox, “Succession”; Kieran Culkin, “Succession”; Gary Oldman, “Slow Horses”; Pedro Pascal, “The Last of Us”; Jeremy Strong, “Succession”; DOminic West, “The Crown.”

Female actor in a television comedy: Rachel Brosnahan, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”; Quinta Brunson, “Abbott Elementary”; Ayo Edebiri, “The Bear”; Elle Fanning, “The Great”; Selena Gomez, “Only Murders in the Building”; Natasha Lyonne, “Poker Face.”

Male actor in a television comedy: Bill Hader, “Barry”; Steve Martin, “Only Murders in the Building”; Jason Segel, “Shrinking”; Martin Short, “Only Murders in the Building”; Jason Sudeikis, “Ted Lasso”; Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear.”

The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it’s been tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which votes on the awards.

Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of color to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew.

In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly’s Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. In mid-November, CBS announced that it would air the ceremony on the network on Jan. 7. It will also stream on Paramount+.

The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars.

The show was touted as a boozy, A-list party, whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their academy counterparts. It also only honored the flashiest filmmaking categories — picture, director, actors among them — meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of shorts no one has heard of.

But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favor and win votes.

Some years, the HFPA were pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big name talent with hopes of getting them to the show, the most infamous being “The Tourist,” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they’ve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television.

Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, it was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers to the broadcast. This year, NBC’s Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.

The group nominating and voting for the awards is now made up of a more diverse group of over 300 people from around the world."
9,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Warriors' Steph Curry shows frustrations over mediocre start,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/11/steph-curry-frustrated-over-mediocre-start-im-sick-of-talking-about-it-we-just-have-to-do-it/,"The Warriors arrived in Phoenix with a troubling 10-12 record at a crucial point.

A team, a Hall of Fame core, that’s already carved out a distinguished place in NBA history is grappling with its identity. Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Steve Kerr are on a mission to prove that they still run this league, but are stumbling too much not to raise questions about their vitality.

The motion offense has often looked stale. Players outside of Curry haven’t been able to close a significant scoring gap. Through the first 22 games, the Warriors haven’t dominated any facet of the game. They are what their record is, as Kerr put it, with some faith that all the ways they can succeed on paper will come to fruition.

But how many more stumbles until the Warriors call it? The season is only a quarter-way through, but the season may be swirling the toilet if this mediocrity continues through the winter. Curry seems to see the big picture.

“Got to figure out how to stop talking about it and do it, otherwise you’ll be into the new year with the same problems,” Curry told reporters in Oklahoma City. “Whatever it is, if it’s within our control, we have to do it if we are going to be a serious team. I’m sick of talking about it, too. We just have to do it.”

“It,” in this case, means crystalizing an identity. With Chris Paul in tow, Golden State entered the season positioned as the smartest team in the room, the pedigreed organization with the savvy to force younger teams into mistakes and flubs. Curry, even in his mid-30s, can still lead a team to the mountaintop. He’s still the face of the NBA and a proven maestro in high-stakes games.

Save for Curry’s heroics, that identity hasn’t shown itself much. Often the veterans have been the ones making head-scratching mistakes and victims of their own emotion; the older guys are at the center of a dismal 15.8% turnover rate, Green has twice been ejected and also was suspended for five games.

Veterans take the blame for this tepid start.

“I don’t feel the urgency we need to have, and that’s on me,” Green said on Friday. “I will be better about that, making sure guys have the urgency that they need. It hasn’t been there and you can’t claim to lead in that department when it’s going well so I take that on the chin and make sure this team plays with better sense of urgency, and I will.”

Slightly alarming is coaches and players’ propensity to hang onto moral victories. Sure, they’ve lost each of their last three road games, but all three have been by a combined four points — the first time that’s happened to Golden State. The silver lining is that they’re controlling most games against good and bad teams, the cloud is that they lack composure to maintain the lead.

Playing the shoulda-coulda-woulda game, a few things go differently and the Warriors are up a few games in the win column. Only three wins separate them from the 11th seed, where they currently sit, from the third seed, where the 13-8 Dallas Mavericks sit.

“Right now it’s just about winning games,” Curry said. “You can’t let too much of this early part of the year go by without getting some type of safety net in the standings. As you work through some of the kinks we have to work through and get to full strength, you don’t want to be chasing come the new year and February. It’s hard enough to win on a nightly basis, let along make a late-season charge with that kind of pressure. Every game is important, for sure. We’re approaching it that way it just isn’t turning into wins.

“You get over .500 and built momentum, it can change the vibe of your team really quickly because winning cures a lot of frustrations.”

The season is early, there’s plenty of time for a vibe change. But how this next month goes could determine if all their pieces make a whole worth keeping together before the trade deadline in February. In the next month, it will be determined if the Warriors can contend as is, if they should pursue flipping some of their movable contracts — such as Paul or Thompson — for another scorer or just stop running.

“No other team in the NBA isn’t dealing with the things we’re dealing with,” Green told reporters. “You have to be mentally strong enough to figure it out. Those who do, win. Those that don’t lose close games.

“We got all the pieces that we need to win You look at some of the game we’re losing, we have to tighten up in the margins. But we know what it takes to win a championship and we have all those things.”"

PASS OFFENSE: A-

Brock Purdy not only passed for 368 yards and two touchdowns, and he not only mixed in deep shots with smart checkdowns, he also produced his seventh straight game with a 70%-plus completion percentage, which is one shy of Joe Montana’s NFL record in 1989. He’s not taking a victory lap alone, saying: “I’m part of a special group.” That includes Deebo Samuel (seven catches, 149 yards; 54-yard go-ahead touchdown), Brandon Aiyuk (six catches, 126 yards; second-straight 1,000-yard season), and George Kittle (44-yard touchdown). Each of those three had a catch over 40 yards, but Purdy and coach Kyle Shanahan’s favorite strike was a checkdown that Samuel took 30 yards once Purdy went through his progression. The Seahawks sacked Purdy three times and hit him seven as the line adjusted with Jon Feliciano in at right guard for Spencer Burford.

RUN OFFENSE: A-

McCaffrey sped off 72 yards on the opening snap en route to a 145-yard outing as the NFL’s leading rusher (1,177 yards). But McCaffrey was predictably steamed at getting tackled at the 3-yard line after some “amazing blocking” on that first carry, which meant getting pulled for a breather so Jordan Mason could enter and score the 49ers’ first touchdown. McCaffrey did not score for only the second time in 26 starts. He is 210 yards and three touchdown runs away from his 2019 totals, when he became the third player in NFL history to hit the 1,000-yard mark both rushing and receiving for a last-place, five-win Panthers team that can’t compare to this joy of success and stats.

PASS DEFENSE: B-

Drew Lock was a game-time replacement for Geno Smith and kept things too close through three quarters. He threw a tight, 31-yard touchdown pass to D.K. Metcalf over Ambry Thomas, who had to cover the Seahawks’ top threat once Charvarius Ward exited that first series with a groin injury. Lock’s 25-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter made it a 21-16 score, which was too close for the 49ers’ comfort, so they teed off on him in the fourth quarter with three sacks and two interceptions, plus a Deommodore Lenoir interception that got nullified by a Nick Bosa offside penalty. Bosa, Clelin Ferrell, Randy Gregory and Javon Kinlaw combined for the four sacks this game, Bosa’s 1 ½ raising his season total to 9 ½. Injuries are noticeably impacting this unit’s communication and leading to missed tackles. Javon Hargrave (hamstring) joined inactive defensive tackle Arik Armstead (foot, knee) on the sideline. Ward has had groin issues in the past so that’s a concern, but the 49ers are expected to officially re-sign Jason Verrett to the practice squad Monday.

RUN DEFENSE: A-

Missed tackles by Dre Greenlaw and Ambry Thomas allowed Zach Charbonnet to run 23 yards on back-to-back carries, setting up a go-ahead field goal for the Seahawks. Charbonnet, however, had five other carries for minus-2 yards. Kenneth Walker III gained just 21 yards on eight plays. Needless to say, Fred Warner (team-high eight tackles, career-high fourth interception this season) is en route to a career-best year. “He’s going to be a lock All-Pro. He’s the best at his position in the league,” Bosa said of Warner. “He’s just the best and that’s no question.”

SPECIAL TEAMS: B

Seeing Samuel get slammed at the 15-yard line on a kick return should give the 49ers pause in moonlighting him there; Ray-Ray McCloud went on Injured Reserve on Saturday. Ronnie Bell had punt returns of 16 and 11 yards, but not in a confidence-inspiring way. As for that 30-yard run by punter Mitch Wishnowsky, coach Kyle Shanahan said he didn’t call a fake; Wishnowsky would be denied his first career carry because of offsetting penalties (Bell illegal block, Seahawks’ unnecessary roughnes for hitting Wishnowsky out of bounds).

COACHING: A-

The 49ers’ win streak is at five, matching their season-opening stretch, and that’s put Kyle Shanahan’s squad in firm control of the NFC West for a second straight year. It’s a four-game lead with four games to go, including a Week 18 date with the still-contending Rams (6-7). The Niners (10-3) can clinch a playoff berth tonight if the Packers (6-6) lose at the Giants (4-8). Next Sunday brings perhaps the 49ers’ penultimate road trip this season, to the last-place Arizona Cardinals, who are coming off their bye (as was the case when the 49ers played the Browns, the Bengals and the Jaguars). While the 49ers are 5-0 since defensive coordinator Steve Wilks moved from the booth to the sideline, his unit has played with more looks and more fire than the first two months."
11,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,America is becoming a country of YIMBYs,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/11/is-america-is-becoming-a-country-of-yimbys/,"New York — Public support is building for changes to zoning codes and other laws that have dominated American housing policy for decades and restricted new development.

A new Pew Charitable Trusts poll shows broad public approval for several policy initiatives that would make it easier to build new housing, especially apartments.

The poll comes amid a severe housing shortage, a loose coalition of grassroots YIMBY leaders — short for Yes in My Backyard — and bipartisan housing policy reform efforts from Utah to Vermont.

“The results reflect Americans’ broad concern about housing costs,” Pew Charitable Trusts researchers said in a report.

The median home sale price in 2022 was $386,300, up 10.2% from 2021 and the highest on record, and housing construction has failed to keep up with demand. The US housing market is short some 6.5 million homes. Rents reached record highs last year, hitting $2,054, according to Redfin.

The Pew poll found strong support for policies such as legalizing accessory dwelling units, commonly known as granny flats, on single-family zoned areas; legalizing duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes; reforms to create affordable housing development near major transit; and simplifying the housing permitting process.

Efforts to expedite permitting processes gained the broadest support, with 86%, while at the lower end, 49% approved of the ideas of allowing smaller lots and homes to be built closer together.

The limits of support

Support for policies to allow more housing cut across party, region, race, income and gender lines, Pew found. The eight most popular proposals received majority support from Republicans, Democrats and independents. Nine of the 10 policy measures polled received majority support from both renters and homeowners.

Republicans and Democrats prioritized housing reform efforts for different reasons in some cases. More Republicans than Democrats identified fewer property regulations as an excellent or good reason for housing reforms, while more Democrats than Republicans chose reducing racial segregation as an excellent or good reason.

The poll, fielded in September among a sample of 5,000 US adults, is one of the largest to date on housing issues.

And there is evidence suggesting that pro-housing policies are achieving their intended effects, slowing the rocketship of housing prices.

In Minneapolis; Portland, Oregon; New Rochelle, New York; and Tysons Corner, Virginia, new zoning rules that allow more housing have helped slow rent growth, according to a study this year by Pew Charitable Trusts. Towns and cities in the same metro areas that did not reform zoning laws generally saw faster rent growth. While rents nationwide grew 31% nationwide from 2017 to 2023, rents in those four cities all grew under 5%, according to the study.

Despite the favorable polling on housing reforms, local political opposition to new housing development in single-family neighborhoods often can remain strong. People tend to be supportive of more housing in general, just as long as it’s not right next to them.

“One of the tricky parts of housing politics is that a lot of Americans sincerely believe that their city needs more housing but are then unenthusiastic about any specific housing development on their street,” said Salim Furth, a senior research fellow and director of the Urbanity project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. “A challenge for reformers is to resolve this inconsistency.”

For example, Connecticut, Arizona and New York have attempted zoning changes, but efforts have stalled amid blowback. One New York lawmaker warned of a “suburban uprising” if Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to build 800,000 new homes over a decade went through. The plan included changes to zoning laws in suburbs near rail stations.

Roughly 75% of land that is zoned for housing in American cities is for private, single-family homes only.

In some suburbs, zoning laws make it illegal to build apartments in nearly all residential areas. Some municipalities have also made minimum lot sizes bigger and added height requirements. This has had the effect of encouraging ever-larger single-family homes and limiting housing options, like smaller houses.

In recent years, Minneapolis, Arlington, Gainesville, Charlotte, Walla Walla, Washington, and other cities have reformed single-family zoning laws in response to the housing crisis. Oregon, California, Washington, Montana and Maine have ended them statewide.

According to an August report from George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, more than 200 housing bills were introduced this year in at least 23 states.

13,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,"What did you Google in 2023? 'Barbie,' Israel-Hamas war are among the year's top internet searches",https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/11/what-did-you-google-in-2023-barbie-israel-hamas-war-are-among-the-years-top-internet-searches/,"NEW YORK — Your Google search history for 2023 has arrived.

Well, actually, the world’s. On Monday, the California-based tech giant released its “Year in Search,” a roundup of 2023’s top global queries, ranging from unforgettable pop culture moments (hello, Barbenheimer ), to the loss of beloved figures and tragic news carrying worldwide repercussions.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war topped news trends in 2023, per Google’s global data, followed by queries related to the Titanic-bound submersible that imploded in June, as well as February’s devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

Damar Hamlin was Google’s top trending person on search this year. A safety with the NFL’s Buffalo Bills, Hamlin experienced a near-death cardiac arrest on the field during a January game, but has since completed a celebrated comeback. Actor Jeremy Renner, who survived a serious snowplow accident at the start of 2023, followed. Meanwhile, the late Matthew Perry and Tina Turner led search trends among notable individuals who passed away.

In the world of entertainment, “Barbie” dominated Google search’s movie trends this year — followed by Barbenheimer co-pilot “Oppenheimer” and Indian thriller “Jawan.” In TV, “The Last of Us,” “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia” were the top three trending shows in 2023.

Yoasobi’s “アイドル (Idol)” was Google’s top trending song on search. Jason Aldean’s “Try That In A Small Town” — which soared in the charts after controversy this summer — and Shakira and Bizarrap’s “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” followed.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg for Google’s 2023 global search trends. Bibimbap was the top trending recipe. Inter Miami CF, the new home of Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi, led Google’s sports teams trends. And in the U.S. specifically, many consumers spent 2023 asking why eggs, Taylor Swift tickets and sriracha bottles were so expensive — while “rizz” (recently named Oxford’s word of the year ) was a frontrunner for trending slang definition inquires.

Wikipedia, wrapped. Here are 2023’s most-viewed articles on the internet’s encyclopedia Technology | Merriam-Webster’s 2023 word of the year is the real deal You can find more data, including country-specific lists and trends from years past, on Google’s “Year in Search” archive. The company says it collected its 2023 search results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 27 of this year.

Google isn’t the only one to publish annual data as 2023 draws to a close — and from dictionary lookups to music streams, chances are, you’ve probably seen other lists recapping online activity this year. Last week, for example, Wikipedia released its year-end list of most-viewed entries — with its article about ChatGPT leading the pack.

To mark the search engine’s 25th birthday, Google also released top search data “of all time” across various specific categories. Since 2004 (when the company’s trends data first became available globally), the most-Googled Grammy winner of all time has been Beyoncé, for example, while Portuguese soccer great Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest-searched athlete, and the most-searched movie or TV cast is “Harry Potter.”"

AAA is expecting 7.5 million air travelers, topping the previous record in 2019 of 7.3 million, according to the forecast released on Monday. Average airfare prices are slightly lower than last year, AAA said.

Overall, 115 million Americans are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home this holiday season, making it the second-busiest since 2000, when AAA began tracking holiday travel. The busiest year ever was 2019, which was before the Covid-19 pandemic that disrupted travel worldwide.

15,[California] https://www.mercurynews.com/latest-headlines/,Could Shohei Ohtani’s $700 million contract actually be a bargain for Dodgers?,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/12/11/could-shohei-ohtanis-700-million-contract-actually-be-a-bargain-for-dodgers/,"LOS ANGELES — When is $700 million not $700 million?

Shohei Ohtani’s record-breaking, baseball world-shaking contract with the Dodgers will pay him $700 million for 10 seasons of work, more than a third of the sales price when the Guggenheim Group bought the franchise in 2012.

But the machinations of high finances will make it feel like considerably less for the Dodgers, no doubt a big factor in their willingness to top every other bidder by a large margin.

“This is a unique, historic contract for a unique, historic player,” Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, said in announcing the deal Saturday, referring to it as “a partnership.”

That was not hyperbole.

Ohtani’s deal reportedly includes a significant amount of deferred money – perhaps more than half of the $700 million, according to ESPN’s Jeff Passan. Deferred money is worth less than money paid up front, lowering the real value of the contract and – more importantly – the amount counted against MLB’s Competitive Balance Tax each year.

The Dodgers have done this before. Mookie Betts’ 12-year, $365 million contract includes $115 million in deferred money. Betts will get $8 million to $11 million on July 1 every year from 2033 through 2044, well after his playing career is expected to be over (and his bowling career flourishing). The deferrals lower the real value of Betts’ contract to approximately $306 million and his annual CBT hit to approximately $24 million.

Freddie Freeman’s six-year, $162 million contract with the Dodgers includes $57 million in deferred money. Freeman will be getting $4 million to $5 million on July 1 every year from 2028 through 2040.

The deferrals in Ohtani’s deal were reportedly suggested by the two-time American League MVP himself, motivated by a desire to make it easier for the Dodgers to absorb his salary and still be able to build a championship contender. The Dodgers are certain to top the luxury tax threshold ($237 million) in 2024 once they add the starting pitching they desperately need, but they should be able to avoid the more punitive penalties of the highest bracket.

At the same time, the franchise value – already estimated at $4.8 billion (second only to the New York Yankees in MLB) – is certain to benefit from the “Ohtani bump.”

And whatever the Dodgers pay Ohtani annually will be offset by the revenue the international star will bring to the team. No other free agent has ever offered such a boost to his team’s bottom line.

By signing Ohtani, the Dodgers have just gone into the import-export business in a big way – importing new marketing partners, sponsorships and fans and exporting the team’s brand on an international basis.

Estimates of how much additional revenue the Angels gained by having Ohtani in their uniform ranged as high as $20 million annually. Already more of an international brand than the Angels with the power of the global Guggenheim Group behind them, the Dodgers are certain to leverage Ohtani’s time in their uniform to even more lucrative levels with marketing, sponsorship deals and the like offsetting that $700 million price tag.

The Dodgers already lead the majors in attendance annually with few empty seats to be filled by Ohtani’s addition. But according to secondary ticket sites online, the average price to attend Ohtani’s home debut against the St. Louis Cardinals on March 28 at Dodger Stadium jumped from $228 to $359 when his contract decision was announced on Saturday. Seats behind home plate are reportedly going for as much as $3,500 already.

If Ohtani’s deferred money lowers the real cost of his annual salary (to as low as $50 million by one estimate) and the additional revenue he will bring in could be as much as half of that annually, the two-time superstar suddenly becomes – a real bargain?"

He asks lots of “why” questions that don’t always coincide with the current conversation but are about a previous topic.

Ask Amy: My wife objects to my strategy for mellow shopping with our 3-year-olds Advice | Ask Amy: After this man’s behavior at my wedding, I want my best friend to dump him His two reading teachers have said that he is disrespectful and does not participate enough in class.

We have talked about this – both with the teachers and with him.

He comes home with complete papers, does well on spelling tests and is above grade level on reading assessments.

What they say and what we see coming home doesn’t make sense.

We have asked for examples of situations when he’s disrespectful so we can talk to him about it, but the teachers become vague and won’t give an example.

His other teachers say he is kind and helpful, while also being a bit too talkative, but they say he is on track and doing well.

We want to help solve the issue with his reading teachers, but can’t seem to get straight answers.

He comes home crying sometimes because his reading teachers seem to react so negatively to him.

He’s a good kid (an only child) and we don’t feel he’s disrespectful at home. He is very creative, artistic, and generally a happy and easygoing boy.

Any advice on how to tackle this?

My mother-in-law says to just let it go because he’s fine, but I don’t know.

I’m worried that I’m just not seeing something, and this is uncharted territory for me.

– Uncharted

Dear Uncharted: Your son’s teachers are telling you that your son has problems – or creates problems – in their classroom.

Without details or examples, you don’t have any way to coach your son toward improved behavior. It is ironic (to say the least) that his reading teachers communicate so poorly.

You should start by emailing both of the teachers. Thank them for teaching your son and explain simply and briefly that you are eager to help resolve some of the issues they’ve raised.

You might engage them more thoroughly if you basically throw yourself on their mercy by adding something like, “We are first-time parents and he is our only child, so we don’t have any prior experience dealing with educational or learning problems. We really want to help him succeed, so please detail very plainly and specifically any behavior which you believe needs correction. We welcome your specific suggestions and guidance for how to help him to be the respectful and engaged pupil you deserve to teach.”

After this blatant appeal for help, you should also kick this issue upstairs to the academic counselor and/or principal. Meeting personally with these educators would help to give you a game plan, and it could also put the school administration on notice that these particular teachers are not necessarily setting your son up for success in school.

This is a critical stage for your son. He could emerge as a lively little boy who is excited to learn, or a frustrated child who doesn’t like going to school.

Dear Amy: I picked up my husband’s phone and found a private message to a woman he works with. It started out “Hey, Beautiful.”

I looked up her profile on Facebook and under pictures she has posted of herself he was saying things like “absolutely gorgeous” and “beautiful.”

He had surgery, and we both posted about the surgery on FB, but she messaged privately to ask him how it went. I say she could have read the post like everyone else, and apparently she did because she left a heart emoji on his post.

He says this is all perfectly innocent and there is nothing wrong with it. I say there is a lot wrong with it.

What do you say?

– Disgruntled Wife

Dear Disgruntled: I wonder how your husband would react if you were engaged in an analogous private communication with another man whom your husband had never met: “Hey, gorgeous!” “Hey, handsome!” “Hubba hubba…”

What matters most is not whether it is “wrong,” “innocent” or somewhere in between, but how this makes you feel.

I suggest that you should discuss this, not by labeling the behavior, but by describing your feelings.

Now I am stuck between filling the blanks in my schedule with classes I have to take for my major that either do not interest me or are super-early or late or with classes that I know I would enjoy and would contribute to my education as electives.

I am a sophomore, so I have time to take all the classes I need, but I feel like I will lose my motivation to go to class when it is so cold outside and the subject matter bores me.

What do you suggest I choose?

— Class

DEAR CLASS: Split the difference if you can, and sign up for at least one elective that interests you and one required class at a manageable hour that you will commit to attending.

If you must choose a class that is extremely inconvenient, go for the time of day when you are most likely to be motivated to get yourself there.

Also, you may need to question why the classes in your major do not interest you.

Reality check: Life will be like this a lot. No matter how hard we work, we often do not get exactly what we want when we want it.

DEAR HARRIETTE: I find myself in a difficult situation. I am currently enrolled in medical school, and although it has been a dream of mine for a long time, I’m beginning to feel overwhelmed and unsure if this is the right path for me.

The intense workload and pressure are taking a toll on my mental and physical well-being. I’m considering the possibility of quitting, but I’m torn between pursuing my passion for medicine and acknowledging the toll it’s taking on my overall health.

How can I make my decision without feeling like I’m letting myself down or abandoning a dream I’ve worked so hard for?

I want to make a thoughtful and informed choice about my future, but the fear of disappointment and societal expectations are making this decision even more challenging.

— About To Give Up

DEAR ABOUT TO GIVE UP: Seek out perspective on your situation from others who have had the experience.

Find a TA, hospital resident, student about to finish med school or a trusted professor to talk to about your experience. Ask for advice on how they managed through the tough times.

Seven years ago, one of our brothers became angry at the rest of the family and broke off contact with all of us.

My mother had a fruitcake recipe that all of us like, and for years it has been my custom to make her fruitcake and send it to all my siblings at Christmas. I have continued to do this, including for the brother who has cut off contact. He never acknowledges receipt of it, never says thank you, and I don’t know that he isn’t just throwing it in the trash.

I want to continue to take the high road and keep sending it to him so that 1) He can’t complain that I cut him off, and 2) Maybe at some point there will be a reconciliation.

My husband thinks I am wasting my money, and that my brother’s repeated refusal to acknowledge the gift communicates that he doesn’t want any fruitcake. He thinks I should drop my brother from the fruitcake list.

GENTLE READER: Really? Miss Manners would consider that money (or its equivalent in candied fruit, brandy and such) well spent when it is used to remind your uncaring brother that he has a caring family.

DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am curious about your opinion when TV guests are told, “Thank you for being on the show,” and they reply, “Thank you.”

Why do so many guests skip the “You’re welcome” and go directly to “Thank you,” often without adding “… for having me”?

Do we no longer acknowledge thanks on radio or TV?

GENTLE READER: Actually, there is a lot of thanking that goes on in news programs and interview shows. For example, anchors thank their correspondents, which is more than Miss Manners recalls newspaper editors doing when reporters handed in their copy.

But it is an awkward situation. Don’t you think that “You’re welcome” would sound as if the correspondents had done the anchors a favor?

It is sort of the same with the so-called guests. As the opportunity to sound off on television is considered a boon, return thanks are better than “You’re welcome.”

For that matter, the situation is similar with real guests in ordinary social life. But then it is the guests who thank the hosts first. And “You’re welcome” would not sound quite right, so the hosts just say how delighted they were to have the guests.

DEAR MISS MANNERS: My fiance and I wish to have a small wedding, which we’ve tried to announce from the outset. We are still in the planning process.

19,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Bass, one year in: Progress on homelessness but still a steep climb",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/mayor-karen-bass-inside-safe-program-finishes-its-first-year,"Mayor Karen Bass’ Inside Safe program moved Clifton Grant Jr. from a sidewalk encampment into a room in the Hollywood Le Bon Hotel. “I’ve got something to wake up for now,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had been in office for little more than week when she announced the launch of Inside Safe, her signature program to move homeless Angelenos out of the city’s biggest encampments and under a roof.

The first place she went was a noisy stretch of Cahuenga Boulevard under the 101 Freeway in Hollywood. Working closely with Councilmember Nithya Raman, city and county agencies found beds for about 30 unhoused residents living at or near the overpass.

Last week, the mayor celebrated her first year in office, touting the work her administration has done to address the crisis. By then, 10 more people had set up tents, tarps and at least one cardboard structure on the streets around the overpass that had been targeted by Inside Safe in December 2022.

The return of those encampments offers just one example of the challenges the mayor will face in the second year of her fight against homelessness.

Since taking office, Inside Safe has moved 1,951 people off sidewalks, median strips and alleys in such areas as Echo Park, North Hollywood, Westlake, Van Nuys and South Los Angeles, according to figures compiled by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority covering the period that ended Nov. 30.

At the same time, Bass has struggled to accomplish the crucial next step: moving those same people out of hotels and motels and into actual homes. Just 256 people, or 13% of the people who participated in Inside Safe, were in permanent housing during the time frame examined by LAHSA.

About 1,200 continue to live in hotels and motels, some of them for 10 months or more. An additional 100 or so are in tiny homes, shelters or other types of interim housing. The remainder have exited the program.

If Bass is unable to break the logjam, she will need to lease even more hotel rooms next year, even as her Inside Safe team heads into additional neighborhoods — while also returning to the areas where encampments have reemerged.

When she first took office, Bass expected that the encampment residents would end up staying in interim housing for three to six months. A year into the job, she says a more realistic duration, in at least some cases, will be one to two years.

Bass, in an interview, said the city already had thousands of other homeless residents waiting in line to get into permanent housing by the time Inside Safe was launched. “The question that remains to be answered is, where do the Inside Safe people fall in the line?” she said.

At least some of those other homeless hotel dwellers are losing patience.

Stephanie Ryan, who lived at one point under the Cahuenga overpass, said she has been trying to get into permanent housing for three years. Ryan, 33, has a room at the Highland Gardens, a hotel used by the city as interim homeless housing, although not for Inside Safe. After two separate stays in that facility, plus a stint in a hotel near downtown, Ryan said she has felt the temptation to return to the street.

Ryan said she doesn’t like having her belongings searched when she enters the hotel or having to check in each night. She also dislikes random room inspections.

“I don’t like having to answer for everything I do,” she said. “It’s not like I’m in an apartment where you can come and go.”

By mid-November, the city had agreements to use rooms at 46 hotels, including the 13-story L.A. Grand in downtown Los Angeles and the Motel 6 in Canoga Park, according to a city analysis. Bass has made moves to build out the city’s own interim housing portfolio by purchasing and renovating the 294-room Mayfair Hotel, at a cost of $83 million.

Bass said she is determined to clear the bottleneck that is preventing unhoused residents from getting into homes by fast-tracking the approval of 9,000 units of affordable housing. She also has focused on removing bureaucratic barriers that have delayed the move into permanent housing.

In addition, the mayor promised to send city crews back to the Inside Safe locations where tents have reappeared.

“I guarantee you, by the end of the year, all of those areas will be cleared too,” she said at a briefing last week.

Inside Safe is only one part of Bass’ strategy for combating homelessness. During her first year, she has pushed for the construction of more affordable housing on publicly owned land, including properties owned by Metro. She has fostered a new culture of collaboration between city and county agencies, which historically have been at odds.

Still, no homeless initiative has become more closely linked with Bass than Inside Safe. The program, which received $250 million in this year’s city budget, sends outreach workers to encampments to make voluntary offers of housing — usually hotel and motel rooms.

Bass declared early on that the removal of street encampments would be a key feature of the initiative. More than once, she has said that Angelenos will not believe the city is making serious headway on the homelessness crisis if they continue to see tents in their neighborhoods.

On that front, she has made serious progress.

The Times visited 31 of the 32 Inside Safe locations targeted by Bass by Nov. 30. About three-fourths were either entirely free of encampments or had only a handful of tents — three or fewer.

On Hoover Street in Historic Filipinotown, sidewalks underneath the 101 Freeway that were unusable for years are finally clear of debris. On Culver Boulevard in Del Rey, a median strip that was once home to dozens of people had a single tent last month. In Chatsworth, only a couple of tents could be seen in recent weeks near a flood control channel that runs alongside a Metrolink station.

(The Times did not attempt to assess Inside Safe’s work in Skid Row, the part of the city with the largest concentration of homeless residents, because outreach teams went to different sections of that neighborhood.)

One of the largest Inside Safe operations took place in Venice, where, during the peak of the rainy season, more than 100 people agreed to move indoors. That encampment stretched across four streets and had been a long-standing source of neighborhood anger.

Since that operation, sidewalks in that area have been kept clean and safe, said Connie Brooks, a writer who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years.

“It’s a very different environment,” she said.

Berta Jacobo, who resides in Westlake, said her neighborhood is also more peaceful in the wake of the mayor’s initiative. Outreach workers went to that densely packed neighborhood last month, focusing on several streets between Wilshire Boulevard and 8th Street.

Jacobo, 47, said she and her neighbors contacted the city more than a year ago, well before Bass won her race for mayor, about the heaps of trash and open drug use that they saw at the encampments. In those locations, fires had broken out, destroying at least two cars, she said.

“Things are so much better now,” Jacobo said.

Eight Inside Safe locations visited by The Times — about one-fourth of the total — have at least partially repopulated or were never fully cleared.

In April, the mayor’s team spent several days on the streets that surround El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument in downtown Los Angeles, moving nearly 80 people indoors. On Thursday, those streets had 36 tents or tent-like structures.

Inside Safe also went to a long-standing encampment in Harbor City, helping almost 70 people find interim housing. Last week, that area had a dozen tents.

In South Los Angeles, retired schoolteacher June Richard was thrilled to see Inside Safe visit her neighborhood last spring. On that day, city crews temporarily closed off 49th Street over the 110 Freeway. Outreach workers set up tables and chairs to make arrangements for the area’s unhoused residents.

The atmosphere was festive. By the end of the operation, dozens of people had been moved indoors.

Last week, Richard was no longer enthusiastic. The overpass near her home had four tents on the north side and three on the south. With trash scattered across sidewalks, the neighborhood “looks like a dump,” she said.

“I’ve seen people, a whole family, walking in the middle of the street because they have so much stuff on the overpass,” she said.

At some Inside Safe locations, new barriers make it difficult for homeless residents to return.

In Beverly Grove, city crews have fenced off several median strips on San Vicente Boulevard, adorning them with planters filled with multicolored succulents. In Mar Vista, new fences block the vast majority of the sidewalk on Venice Boulevard under the 405 Freeway.

In Hollywood, the mayor’s team targeted an encampment on El Centro Avenue that had experienced multiple fires, at least one involving a propane tank. Once the tents were gone, planters were added to the street. Months later, bigger ones were put in.

Larry Slade, who heads the homelessness committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., gave the mayor’s work on homelessness a grade ranging from a B-plus to an A-minus, saying she has brought focus and funding to the issue. Still, he worries the crisis may be too big for any mayor to solve.

“Inside Safe is like trying to bail water out of a stream,” he said. “That program is an excellent idea, and she is the right person to lead that effort. I am just concerned that we are really just trying to mitigate a tidal wave.”

*

Of the 1,951 people relocated by Inside Safe through Nov. 30, nearly 400 people have exited the program, with the vast majority returning to homelessness, according to LAHSA’s most recent figures. Fifteen have died.

Bass and her team say that departure rate — nearly 1 in 5 participants — is much lower than that found in the other interim housing programs that serve homeless Angelenos.

Still, the mayor’s initiative has come under sharp scrutiny from the city’s mutual aid groups, which provide food, water, tents and supplies to the city’s homeless population. Some have criticized Bass for sending encampment residents to motels that are far from the neighborhoods where they were living. Others say the hotels lack sufficient social services.

Carla Orendorff, a homeless advocate who lives in Reseda, said Inside Safe participants frequently feel pressure to give up their belongings, signing release forms or offering their consent on video. Unhoused residents have moved into motels, only to learn they are not permitted to have guests in their rooms, making them feel isolated and alone, she said.

One unhoused resident, who moved out of an encampment in Van Nuys, was later found dead of an overdose at his motel, Orendorff said.

“This policy is honestly killing people,” she said.

Asked about those assertions, Bass said the city needs to ensure that Inside Safe has a much better system of social services, including drug addiction treatment. She described that as a “top, top issue” for the coming year.

At the same time, the mayor argued that unhoused residents are much safer in hotels and motels than they are living on the sidewalk, where they are in danger of being raped, injured or killed.

“It is a travesty to leave people on the street,” Bass said.

Clairissa Jones, 24, is aware of the dangers. While living in Skid Row, she said, one assailant struck her with a pipe. Others stole her clothing and cellphones.

“One time I came back and my entire tent was gone,” she said.

Last month, outreach workers with Inside Safe found Jones a room at a hotel near MacArthur Park. Since then, she and her boyfriend have been enjoying the bed and the TV, while also relying on the medical clinic van that comes to the facility.

When Jones thought she had COVID-19, the hotel ordered her an Uber to take her to the hospital.

“I found out at the hospital that I was pregnant,” she said. “I got housing just in time.”

Clifton Grant Jr., 47, a former lab technician, had been living on Selma Avenue in Hollywood when the Inside Safe teams arrived. On that street, homeless encampments stretched on and off for nearly four blocks, occupying sidewalks on both sides of a grade school.

Grant, who grew up in Inglewood, became homeless about five years ago, during a serious mental health crisis. In August, Inside Safe teams moved him into a room in the Hollywood Le Bon Hotel that offered a bathtub, mini-fridge, microwave and queen-size bed. “I was blown away,” he said.

Since entering Inside Safe, Grant has had regular access to his medications and mental health treatment. He has been attending church and is talking about going back to school. He is extraordinarily grateful to the woman he calls “Miss Bass.”

“I’ve got something to wake up for now, with not just misery being upon me,” he said. “I get up, I thank God. I feel like I’ve got a purpose, like I can set goals now that seem achievable.”

Bass returned to Selma Avenue on Wednesday to celebrate the accomplishments of the last year. But in that neighborhood, it was clear that her initiative has a long road ahead.

One block south of Selma, more than a dozen tents lined the south side of Sunset Boulevard. At Hollywood Boulevard and Gower Street — a block east of the Inside Safe location on El Centro Avenue — nearly two dozen tents now cover the sidewalks.

On Cahuenga Boulevard, site of the mayor’s first Inside Safe operation, three people said they had already lived at one or more of the city’s homeless hotels. One said he was recently kicked out for yelling. Another said he got in trouble for having too many recyclables.

Asked about those locations, Bass said that as long as the city continues to have more than 46,000 homeless residents, the Inside Safe operations in Hollywood will be “a drop in the bucket.” Still, she said she remains optimistic — and intends to keep working to bring people off the street.

“We’re going to continue to knock down those barriers,” she said."
20,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Opinion: Same hospital, same injury, same child, same day: Why did one ER visit cost thousands more?",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-11/hospital-healthcare-insurance-medical-billing-bay-area-san-francisco-california,"Two emergency room visits on the same day provided a dramatic example of the arbitrariness of medical billing in the United States.

The Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported that the annual cost of family health insurance jumped to nearly $24,000 this year, the greatest increase in a decade. While insurance executives and employers may cite a plethora of reasons, one of the chief culprits is lack of oversight over the Wild West of healthcare prices.

My friend encountered a dramatic example of this last year after her 4-year-old daughter had the misfortune of suffering the same injury twice in the same day.

The girl’s parents were getting her ready for school one morning when, as her hand was pulled through a shirt sleeve, she experienced severe pain. They took her to the children’s emergency department down the road from their home in the Bay Area, where she was diagnosed with “nursemaid’s elbow” or, more technically, a “radial head subluxation.” Common in young children, whose ligaments are looser than adults’, the partial dislocation is straightforward to diagnose and treat. A simple maneuver of the elbow put it back in place in seconds.

After coming home from school that afternoon, my friend’s daughter was playing with her babysitter when her elbow got out of place again. They went back to the same emergency department and went through the same steps with another doctor.

My friend, who is fortunate enough to have good insurance and the means to pay her share, knew the bills wouldn’t be cheap. What she wasn’t expecting was such a stark illustration of the arbitrary nature of medical billing.

While the bill for the first visit was $3,561, the second was $6,056. Same child, same hospital, same insurance, same diagnosis, same procedure, same day — and yet the price was different by not just a few dollars or even a few hundred dollars, but nearly double.

How do we make sense of this? How can a patient be charged such wildly different prices for the same treatment on the same day?

Advertisement

Emergency room billing consists of hospital fees and professional services fees. The hospital fees include a “facility fee” that is part of every emergency room visit and coded at one of five levels. Level 1 is the simplest — someone needing a prescription, for example — while Level 5 is the most complicated, for problems such as heart attacks and strokes that require significant hospital resources. And of course there can be additional hospital fees for X-rays, medications and the like, which weren’t necessary in the case of my friend’s daughter.

The professional services fees are for the emergency physician and other providers such as radiologists. In this case, there were no fees for professionals other than the emergency room doctor.

But the itemized charges showed the two visits were billed completely differently. The first was charged a Level 1 facility fee and a Level 3 professional fee. And the bill tacked on additional fees, including hospital and professional charges for taking care of the patient’s injured joint.

The second visit, meanwhile, was charged a Level 2 facility fee and a Level 4 professional fee, both higher than that morning. But in contrast to the earlier visit, no other charges appeared.

Why was the same injury coded as more complex and expensive to treat the second time than the first? Why did the coding and billing company decide to charge for additional services for the first visit but not the second?

I know both of the physicians who treated my daughter’s friend; they work in the same group, use the same billing and coding company, and charge the same rates. So the different doctors don’t explain the discrepancy. In my practice, even treating physicians have no access to information about how billing for our services is determined.

My friend and I contacted the hospital’s billing department repeatedly, but they proved unable to provide any rational explanation.

Unfortunately, this isn’t new. About a decade ago, I published a series of studies showing how arbitrary medical billing can be. Hospitals charged fees ranging from $10 to $10,169 for a cholesterol test; $1,529 to $182,995 for an appendicitis hospitalization without complications; and $3,296 to $37,227 for a normal vaginal birth.

Only uninsured patients are asked to pay these sticker prices. But despite the “discounts” granted to insured patients through their insurance companies, these charges end up sneaking into higher premiums and other costs. Medical bills are responsible for about 59% of U.S. bankruptcies.

There are few certainties in life, but one of them is that we will all need healthcare at some point. And another, at least for those of us living in America, is that we have no idea what it will cost or why. This would never be tolerated in any other industry.

What can we do about it? Here’s where we could benefit from a government agency like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which helps regulate banks and other financial entities that perpetrate what have been called “ injustices against everyday Americans .” We need someone to regulate the injustices inflicted on Americans every day at the hands of the healthcare system too. Recent efforts by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to police healthcare mergers and address other anticompetitive behavior in the industry could also help.

More government regulation and oversight won’t address the more fundamental problem that we keep trying to treat healthcare as a market good, which it clearly isn’t. But it could help ensure that treating a minor injury one afternoon doesn’t cost twice as much as it did that morning.

21,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Blizzards, tornadoes and a hurricane: We lived through SoCal’s year of weird weather",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-11/southern-california-weather-strange-weird-abnormal-records-2023,"How to describe the weather in Southern California this year?

All that rain? That snow? Spring floods and a summertime hurricane?

“Distinctly different,” says Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who chooses his words carefully.

Maybe it was more than different. As the rest of the planet followed a predictable if worrisome pattern, setting records for heat and rising sea levels, Southern California didn’t know which way to turn. It was downright weird.

Let the numbers tell the story.

For the first time, the National Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning for the Southern California region. Though Hurricane Hilary lost some ferocity and was downgraded to a tropical storm by landfall in mid-August, it was undeniably historic.

More than 3 inches of rain fell in Burbank and more than three times that much soaked the mountains, obliterating a slew of records that dated back to 1877 when the weather service began tracking data.

There were mudslides, flash floods and widespread power outages. Still, we may have gotten lucky.

“The flooding wasn’t catastrophic,” Swain says. “It could have been worse.”

California Full coverage of Hilary An unprecedented tropical storm watch has been issued for Southern California as Hilary barrels north toward the United States.

Tornadoes aren’t unprecedented in Southern California — they crop up from time to time. This year, we got two violent twisters in two days.

It was late March and a powerful storm front was dumping record rainfall on Los Angeles. In other parts of the state, major rivers overflowed their banks, flooding communities and farmlands.

The first tornado touched down in Carpinteria, lasting about two minutes and damaging 25 units in a mobile home park. The following afternoon, the strongest twister to hit L.A. County in four decades ripped through Montebello with 110-mph winds that left 17 buildings damaged, 11 of them badly enough to be red-tagged.

“When it’s happening, you don’t know what to do,” says a woman who watched people running for cover outside her Montebello workplace, “because it’s never happened here before.”

Each winter, a few dozen atmospheric rivers, or ARs, drift over California. Like rivers flowing across the sky, these streams of water vapor stretch for thousands of miles, carrying moisture from the tropics — hence the nickname “pineapple express.”

This year was extraordinary because there were nine in the three weeks between Christmas and mid-January, arriving one after another like planes on approach to LAX. Six were rated at least a 3 out of 5 based on strength and duration.

“That number of strong ARs is what we might get in a whole year,” says Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “We had a lot of extra action.”

Downtown L.A. received more than double its average rainfall for those few weeks when compared with previous years.

The average temperature in downtown L.A. for September was 72 degrees — 5 degrees cooler than last year.

Sure, there were hot stretches in places such as Woodland Hills and Lancaster, but overall summer temperatures were below normal through much of Southern California. Credit all those low-pressure systems, the overcast days and Hilary taking a bite out of August.

In San Diego, Ralph could feel the difference.

“Coldest summer I can remember,” he says. “I mean, it was cloudy and chilly.”

The blizzard that hit Southern California in late February started in the Gulf of Alaska, but along the way it tapped into that tropical AR system, gathering extra moisture into its icy clutches.

Snow fell as low as 1,000 feet, painting local mountains a brilliant white and offering the once-in-a-lifetime chance to go backcountry skiing within Los Angeles city limits.

Big Bear and neighboring communities got buried under as much as 12 feet, blocking roads and causing San Bernardino County to declare a state of emergency. As Swain says: “How often do you see people trapped in their homes due to snowfall? That is not common in Southern California.”

Thirteen people died during the back-to-back storms and their aftermath. Though county officials ruled only one of those deaths to be weather-related, residents have questioned the finding.

That might seem like a big number, but the 319,956 acres of land burned in California wildfires as of last week are even less than 2022’s unusual low of 363,939. They are but a fraction of 4.3 million scorched in 2020 and 2.5 million in 2021.

Though unusual rainfall led to a thicker carpeting of grasses, brush and trees, the moisture content and cooler temperatures hampered ignition. With fewer blazes to fight, state and local crews had more time to work on fuel reduction.

“We didn’t have those sweltering, scorching heat conditions,” Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Chris Bruno says. “We absolutely took advantage of the opportunity.”

There are 21 days until 2024. Is this year a harbinger for stranger things to come?

Long-range forecasts are risky, especially months down the road, but even a cautious Swain says: “I think that’s a plausible line of inquiry.”"
22,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,Column: Sacramento politicians need the guts to fix California’s money woes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-11/sacramento-politicians-need-the-guts-to-fix-californias-money-woes,"California state government’s bank account has dwindled from a nearly $100-billion surplus 18 months ago to a projected $68-billion deficit.

How could that possibly happen?

Three reasons:



Sacramento politicians haven’t had the guts to fix a very flawed roller-coaster tax system that generates barrels of revenue in good times but goes bust when the economy sours.

They spend too much money. That’s self-evident. At any rate, they’re spending more than the state is taking in. A lot more.

All that aside, rising interest rates cooled the economy by increasing borrowing costs. That stifled home buying and business expansions, according to independent Legislative Analyst Gabriel Petek, who projected the $68-billion deficit last week.

The analyst says the state stumbled into the red ink hole partly because the federal government extended the normal tax filing deadline this year from April until November. It wanted to ease life for Californians harmed by last winter’s drenching storms. California followed the feds’ lead and did the same.

So what? It meant Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators didn’t know how much revenue they had to spend before the deadline for passing a budget. They needed to enact a spending plan by the start of the fiscal year July 1. But the revenue data weren’t available until tax returns were filed in the fall.

Their solution was to blindly overestimate the taxes the state would collect.

If they’d known the revenue flow was slowing, mitigating steps could have been taken: spending cuts, tapping reserves, internal borrowing.

“The [tax filing] delay really messed us up,” says H.D. Palmer, Newsom’s budget spokesman. “If we’d had that cash data on hand in spring like normal, it would have required solutions to close the gap and we’d have a much smaller problem today.”

OK, but they could have had the foresight to act long before spring. On Newsom’s watch starting in 2019, annual state spending has jumped by 53% — more than $100 billion from the $203-billion budget he inherited from Gov. Jerry Brown to $311 billion currently.

But overspending is only part of the problem. There’s another part that neither Republicans nor most Democrats want to talk about: a volatile tax system that overreacts to economic changes.

Less money came in than expected because of California’s warped tax system. It relies mostly on wealthy-income taxpayers — regardless of whether they’re having a good or bad year. The system functions like a yo-yo, performing erratically depending on whether the economy is booming or busting.

Specifically, the state feeds off taxes on rich people’s capital gains, especially their stock earnings. Sometimes stocks tumble. And capital gains become investment losses.

The top 1% of earners pay nearly 50% of the state income tax. And the top one-tenth of 1% pay 28%.

“These lucky folks get a lot of their income from capital gains and stock options,” Palmer says. “It turns out that 2022 was not a great year for the financial market. The Nasdaq dropped 33%, the biggest drop since the Great Recession in ‘08. The Nasdaq is relevant because of California’s high-tech economy.”

The top 10% of earners — with taxable incomes above $200,000 — kick in roughly 80% of the tax. California has a very progressive tax system, with the lower 60% of earners paying only around 2%.

The legislative analyst says the state took in $26 billion less than expected in the last fiscal year — ”a severe revenue decline.” And he forecasts a “serious” $68-billion deficit through the next fiscal year.

Personal income tax receipts were 22% — $19 billion — less than forecast just from April through November, Palmer says.

Putting this in perspective, the personal income tax supplies two-thirds of the state general fund. Back in 1950, when our tax system was stable, the income tax accounted for only 10%. Then, the sales tax was the main revenue source, feeding 60% of the general fund. Today it’s just 16%.

A big reason the sales tax has diminished in importance is that we’ve become less of a retail economy and more of a service economy. But we’re one of the few states that don’t tax services. Our tax system is stuck in the mid-20th century and should be modernized.

What’s needed is to reduce income tax rates at all levels and extend the sales tax to services.

That doesn’t mean taxing haircuts, lawn mowing and baby sitting. But we could tax labor on car repairs, as parts already are. Tax Lakers tickets and concerts. More important, tax attorney, accountant and interior designer fees — services used mostly by big business and the wealthy.

But that thought scares politicians. Most would love to vote for an income tax cut. And it would require only a simple majority vote of the Legislature. But extending the sales tax to services would necessitate a two-thirds vote. That would take strong gubernatorial and legislative leadership. And it has never materialized. Too politically risky.

Former state Controller Betty Yee, a Democrat who’s running for governor, advocated such tax reform for years but backed off.

“People focus on one aspect without looking at the entire system and then just beat me up for wanting to tax services,” Yee told me. “It’s very hard for people to put their arms around the entire system.”

So Newsom and the Legislature will probably cut school funding, trim some other spending, tap into savings, borrow internally and shamefully deploy fiscal gimmickry to “balance” the next budget.

And our tax system will continue to perform erratically."

One firefighter suffered an unknown injury and was transported to a hospital about 7:30 p.m., Crabtree said.

No other injuries were reported.

The church was built in 1924 as the Second Church of Christ Scientist. The building, with its Neoclassical Revival-style, Corinthian columns and visual landmark central dome, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The cause of the fire is under investigation, and the extent of the damage to the building is not immediately known."

John Brooks Slaughter, a pioneering engineer who served as the first Black director of the National Science Foundation and the first Black president of Occidental College, died Wednesday at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. He was 89.

Over the course of a trailblazing career that spanned more than six decades, Slaughter became a leading voice in both engineering and diversity initiatives, advocating for Black voices at major institutions across the country. For his efforts, he received the inaugural U.S. Black Engineer of the Year award in 1987.

“We are deeply saddened by the passing of a remarkable trailblazer, John Brooks Slaughter, the first Black Engineer of the Year. His pioneering spirit and monumental contributions have left an indelible mark on the engineering field and beyond,” U.S. Black Engineer Magazine said in a statement.

During his 11-year tenure as president of Occidental, Slaughter transformed it into one of the nation’s most diverse liberal arts schools. At his inauguration in 1989, he said, “Quality and equality are inseparable and diversity is synonymous with what is best in America.”

Under his leadership, Occidental became a premier liberal arts college with increased applications and community-building initiatives. Slaughter also oversaw a fundraising campaign that raised $72 million in five years for academic programs, scholarships and construction projects.

A year before he retired from Occidental, he told The Times that he was proudest of bringing new faces to the college.

“People have for a long time believed that if you focus on diversity and equality that you have to sacrifice quality in students and faculty,” he said. “We’ve shown that both can rise at the same time.”

The college’s flag will be flown at half-staff this week in his memory.

“The Occidental College community is deeply saddened by the passing of President Emeritus Slaughter. He is widely remembered for his positive leadership, warm personality and strong sense of integrity,” said Rod Leveque, Occidental’s vice president for marketing and communications. “He was a transformative leader whose dual commitments to excellence and equity continue to shape who we are today. Our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.”

Slaughter was born in Topeka, Kan., and earned engineering degrees from Kansas State University, UCLA and UC San Diego. He joined the National Science Foundation in 1977 and became the director three years later, placing an emphasis on funding science programs at historically Black colleges and universities.

“I made every effort to make them realize that they could be successful in competing for grants at the NSF,” Slaughter told the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for a profile in 2023.

After butting heads with the Reagan administration, which sought to cut funding for science education, he resigned in 1982 and took the chancellor position at the University of Maryland.

In addition to his stints at the University of Maryland and Occidental, Slaughter served on numerous boards and committees, including the California Citizens Commission on Higher Education and the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now.

From 2000 to 2009, he served as president of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, spearheading the same diversity initiatives that he did in his previous leadership roles.

In 2010, he became a professor of education and engineering at USC, teaching courses on leadership, diversity and technological literacy. He retired from the role in 2022. A year later, USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering renamed the Center for Engineering Diversity in his honor: the John Brooks Slaughter Center for Engineering Diversity.

Slaughter is survived by his wife, Bernice Slaughter, his son, John II, and his daughter, Jacqueline."
25,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,‘Despicable act of hate’: Suspect arrested after antisemitic assault in Beverly Hills,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-10/arrest-made-in-the-antisemitic-assault-of-an-elderly-man-in-beverly-hills,"A suspect was arrested after allegedly attacking an elderly man in Beverly Hills and making antisemitic remarks during the assault.

Raphael Nissel and his wife were walking to their Beverly Hills synagogue on Saturday morning when a man struck Nissel’s head from behind with a belt buckle.

Nissel, who wore a yarmulke, was left dazed and bloodied by the attack.

“My wife told me, ‘Watch out!’” Nissel, 75, told The Times on Sunday. “All of a sudden, something hard hit my forehead.”

The assailant turned to Nissel’s wife, Rivka and allegedly said, “Jew, give me your jewelry” but fled after Nissel gave chase.

Officers responded to a report of an assault with a deadly weapon that morning at North Rexford Drive and North Santa Monica Boulevard, near the Beverly Hills Police Department. They took over the pursuit of the suspect.

Nissel suffered a deep cut to his head, which he said required four “staples,” and was treated at the scene.

Scheduled to give a reading that day from the Torah at Young Israel of North Beverly Hills, an orthodox synagogue, Nissel didn’t allow the attack to deter him.

“My wife had to run to the house to bring me a new shirt,” he said. “I walked to the synagogue and was able to perform.”

Based on a description of the suspect, police later found and arrested Jarris Jay Silagi.

In a Sunday afternoon news release, Beverly Hills Police Chief Mark Stainbrook said his officers acted swiftly in taking Silagi into custody.

“This despicable act of hate against a member of our community will not be tolerated,” Stainbrook said.

Silagi, 44, of Los Angeles was booked on the suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, attempted robbery, elder abuse and a hate crime. A prior conviction for an attempted second-degree robbery in 2012 also occurred in Beverly Hills.

Silagi is being held at Los Angeles County Jail on $100,000 bail.

He is due at the Los Angeles Airport Courthouse on Tuesday as Beverly Hills police continue their investigation.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the attack a “vile act” in a Sunday afternoon post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.

A hate crimes report released last month by the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission found that anti-Jewish offenses skyrocketed by 59% last year and accounted for an overwhelming majority of religiously motivated hate crimes.

Officials have also noted a sharp rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish hate crimes since the Israel-Hamas war began Oct. 7 which were not included in the 2022 report.

Bass pledged that the city would continue to work with its partners to “actively combat antisemitism.”

Nissel appreciated the mayor’s comments.

“I’m doing well,” Nissel said. “The most important part are the incidents we have to prevent in the future.”"

Huntington Park police responding to a call of a road rage incident Saturday afternoon shot at the suspected driver involved after he rammed their patrol vehicles following a pursuit, authorities said.

The 51-year-old man, who was not identified, was treated at a nearby hospital for an apparent gunshot wound to his upper body and was in critical but stable condition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which is investigating, said in a news release Sunday.

The department said the shooting occurred Saturday after police officers responded to a report about 3 p.m. of a road rage incident in Huntington Park in southeast Los Angeles County.

After police attempted to pull over the suspect’s vehicle, the driver fled to Hacienda Heights, where he rammed multiple Huntington Park police vehicles, prompting police to open fire, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

The owner of a shuttered Riverside County foster home for disabled children has been charged with murder a second time in the death of a teenager in the home in 2019, which prompted an investigation that prosecutors say uncovered sexual abuse and other crimes involving multiple victims.

Michelle Morris-Kerin and her husband, Edward Lawrence “Larry” Kerin, were initially charged in 2021 with a 14-count indictment that alleged “child endangerment likely to cause great bodily injury or death, dependent adult endangerment likely to cause great bodily injury or death, and lewd acts on a dependent adult,” according to the Riverside County District Attorney’s office.

A judge last year dismissed the murder count against Morris-Kerin. Prosecutors filed the charge again after further investigation found additional evidence, the district attorney’s office announced Saturday.

Several agencies launched their investigation following the death of 17-year-old Dianne “Princess” Ramirez. The wheelchair-bound teenager was vomiting blood and was showing “inconsistent vital signs,” but Morris-Kerin decided not to seek help for the girl, prosecutors alleged.

The investigation found that “numerous other residents” of the home near Murrieta had been abused, and that some dependent adults “engaged in sexual activities encouraged by both defendants,” despite lacking “the mental capacity to give consent,” according to the district attorney’s office.

Morris-Kerin, now 82, was charged with 15 counts in an indictment unsealed Thursday, including lewd acts on a dependent adult, murder and other crimes. Kerin, 81, was charged with nine counts, including involuntary manslaughter.

The two were arraigned Thursday and entered not guilty pleas. Morris-Kerin and Kerin were released on bail set at $50,000 and $35,000, respectively.

By Sunday, firefighters reported progress and lifted evacuation orders.

Ventura County firefighters continued to make steady progress Sunday in their battle against a 2,900-acre fire near the town of Somis, lifting previous evacuation orders.

The so-called South fire, which was first reported Saturday on South Mountain, is currently 15% contained and more improvement is expected soon, the Ventura County Fire Department said in a video message on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

As of 8 a.m., evacuation orders were also lifted in the towns of Somis and Santa Paula. An evacuation warning remains in effect in the Saticoy Country Club area, but authorities expect to lift that warning at or before 5 p.m. Sunday.

“We made good progress last night,” Ventura County Fire Department spokesman Andy VanSciver said. “There is no smoke that can be seen.”

More information on the existing evacuation warning and lifted orders can be found at vcemergency.com

The South fire broke out Saturday fueled by Santa Ana winds that blew through many parts of the Southland.

In Riverside County, a vegetation fire broke out as well in the town of Cabazon, growing to 65 acres by early afternoon Saturday.

As of Sunday morning the fire was 65% contained, an improvement from 15% containment Saturday afternoon, according to a social media update from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Riverside County Fire Department.

There is a danger of windy conditions in inland and mountain areas Sunday but that should dissipate as the day progresses, according to the weather service.

There is a high-wind warning in effect until 12 p.m. for the Santa Susana Mountains and less severe wind advisories for much of Ventura County and western portions of L.A. County, including areas of the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley and Malibu. Winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts of up to 45 mph are expected in some areas.

Red flag warnings should lift by 3 p.m., said Rose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard."

The answer will start with perception, not reality",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-10/homeless-unhoused-encampment-interim-housing-karen-bass,"Mayor Karen Bass, accompanied by HUD official Richard J. Monocchio, left, and City Councilmembers Nithya Raman, far left, Hugo Soto-Martinez and Bob Blumenfield, speak to reporters in Hollywood on Wednesday. Previously, it was the site of a homeless encampment.

For as long as people have watched tents take over sidewalks and RVs deteriorate under freeways, politicians have been making promises about solving homelessness in Los Angeles.

And for just as long, those same politicians have been breaking them.

This is undoubtedly why, back in March, as Mayor Karen Bass was approaching her first 100 days in office, only 17% of Angelenos believed her administration would make “a lot of progress” getting people off the streets, according to a Suffolk University/Los Angeles Times poll. Far more — 45% — predicted just “a little progress” would be made.

I was thinking about this deep well of public skepticism while listening to Bass, all smiles in a bright green suit on Wednesday morning, enthusiastically explain why the progress she has actually made is a reason for renewed optimism.

Flanked by members of the L.A. City Council outside a school in Hollywood, she announced that her administration had, in its first year, moved more than 21,694 people out of encampments and into interim housing. That’s an increase of 28% over the final year of former Mayor Eric Garcetti’s administration, taking into account the work of various government programs, including Bass’ signature one, Inside Safe.

In addition, the majority of those directed to motel and hotel rooms, congregate shelters and tiny homes have decided to stay, rather than head back out onto the streets.

“We have tried to set a new tone in the city. This is an example of that new tone. Forty-one people used to sleep here, and now it’s clear,” Bass said Wednesday over the shrieks of schoolchildren. “Students and parents don’t need to walk around tents on their way to school, and the Angelenos who were living here do not need to die on our streets.”

It was a convincing message, backed up by a thick packet of numbers distributed to reporters at City Hall a few hours later.

But numbers are funny. They can be crunched in many ways and interpreted to mean many different things.

As my Times colleague David Zahniser pointed out, all of the people who now live in interim housing are still considered homeless by the federal government. And while Bass had originally thought most of them would be there for only three to six months, it’s now looking more like 18 months to two years. Permanent housing is that scarce.

So, numbers-wise, don’t expect a decline in the next annual homelessness count, which is scheduled for January. There might even be an increase, thanks to the expiration of pandemic-era tenant protections. As of the last count, there were more than 46,000 unhoused people living in the city, mostly in encampments.

But again, numbers are funny. They tend not to mean half as much as what people see and experience for themselves, just like the disconnect between public perceptions of crime and actual crime data.

So, when Bass declares at a news conference that “we have proved this year that we will make change,” and she talks about the encampment that used to be where she’s standing and all the encampments that her administration has cleared, even if a few more tents have popped up down the street, skeptical Angelenos just might believe her.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s not such a bad thing.

“What I see most powerfully is increased hope,” Va Lecia Adams Kellum, chief executive of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, told reporters on Wednesday. “Hope among the folks who are living in those encampments who had given up and [thought] they’ll always live in that level of despair. Hope that the community now believes that we could possibly get out of this terrible crisis.”

Kellie Waldon, 54, cries near what’s left of her encampment, left, as Skid Row West is dismantled under the 405 Freeway along Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles in October. Waldon was hoping to receive housing through the city’s Inside Safe program, like others in the encampment had. “You get your hopes up and you don’t know what to believe,” Waldon said. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)

Hope is a thing difficult to quantify, especially among people who have been homeless for years, and have suffered so much and have been let down so often by government.

I’ve talked to some who took a chance and decided to leave their tents and RVs, and are now thrilled to be in a motel room with a door, running water and air conditioning. Others have had it with curfews and jail-like rules, and are getting tired of waiting on promised permanent housing.

I’ve also talked to those who have been booted out of interim housing for one reason or another, and are back on the streets. They are feeling hopeless, like many cash-strapped Angelenos who are on the verge of an eviction.

But peak hopelessness? That’s what we saw on the first days of December.

At a hastily called news conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore announced that officers were searching for a man who had fatally shot three homeless people — one sleeping on a couch in an alley and another while pushing a shopping cart.

“This is a killer preying on the unhoused,” Bass said.

Moore and Bass didn’t know then, but their suspect, Jerrid Joseph Powell, had already been arrested by Beverly Hills police after a traffic stop in which his $60,000 BMW was linked to a deadly follow-home robbery.

Police have yet to elaborate on Powell’s alleged motive, but Bass brought up the horrific case several times on Wednesday — and with good reason. Violence and acts of cruelty against people living on the streets are increasingly common not just locally, but nationally.

In addition to shootings, there have been stabbings and beheadings. And let’s not forget about the gallery owner in San Francisco who was caught on video spraying a homeless woman with a hose.

California The twisted path of Jerrid Powell, from jock to accused L.A. serial killer More than a week after the arrest of Jerrid Joseph Powell in connection with the shooting deaths of three homeless men and an L.A. county employee, much remains wrapped in mystery, including a motive in the slayings.

Advocates blame this trend of nastiness on the pandemic-era surge in homelessness, particularly in unsheltered homelessness, and the subsequent spike in interactions between housed and unhoused residents. Fear and frustration can lead to dehumanization and that, in turn, can lead to violence, said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative in San Francisco.

“I do really worry that it’s become normalized in public discourse to speak about people experiencing homelessness as, like, a problem for those who are not homeless — as opposed to fundamentally a massive societal failure that’s left usually older, vulnerable people terrified and totally unprotected,” she told me. “And I do think that there is a connection, like the more we dehumanize people, the less protected they are.”

Stephanie Klasky-Gamer has watched this happen in real time as president and CEO of L.A. Family Housing. The seeming permanency of encampments, and the trash, fires and unsanitary conditions they often generate, have led to what she describes as widespread impatience.

“I don’t mean big, systemic impatience, like ‘I wish we could end homelessness faster,’” she said. “It’s the ‘I’m just sick of seeing you in front of me’ kind of impatience.”

On some level, she gets it, though. As does Kushel. As do I.

“It has to be OK to say, ‘Yeah, this sucks that I’m walking my kids to school and I’m walking over people in tents,’” Kushel told me. “But there has to be a way to hold that with being able to recognize how we got to this position and also how we’re going to get out. And to sort of restore [our] collective humanity.”

For Klasky-Gamer, this has meant focusing on what has changed since Bass became mayor.

“I know how much good is getting done,” she told me. “The frustration I may feel at seeing the tent every day I turn the corner, at least I can temper it knowing that 10 people yesterday moved into an apartment. These three people haven’t. But these 10 did.”

The mayor has told me many times that getting people off the streets isn’t just a humanitarian imperative — and, as a serial killer reminded us, a safety imperative. It’s also a demonstration to a fed-up public that progress is possible.

“What distresses Angelenos the most are encampments. That’s where people were dying on the street,” Bass told reporters. “And to me, what was clear, was that we come up with a way to get people out of the tents.”

Some will dismiss that. They’ll insist that all her administration is doing is reducing visible homelessness to score easy political points. And that instead of doing the hard work of actually helping L.A.’s most vulnerable residents get back on their feet, the mayor is hiding them so that they’ll be forgotten and abandoned in interim housing.

In this city, defined by its haves and have-nots, I understand the cynicism and skepticism. But that’s why what Bass does next, namely expanding and stabilizing the city’s crumbling supply of permanent housing, will matter even more than what she has done thus far.

“We’ve got to somehow make people believe again that this is solvable,” Kushel told me, “and it is solvable.”

Hope can be elusive. But Annelisa Stephan was looking for it anyway when she came to the Ballona Wetlands on a recent Saturday morning.

She and more than 100 other volunteers — many of them from the nearby neighborhoods of Playa Vista and Playa del Rey — had descended on the Westside ecological reserve to dig holes, spread soil, and put in plants and trees.

Just a few months ago, RVs had been parked here along Jefferson Boulevard, bumper to bumper in a sprawling encampment that dozens of unhoused people had come to call home.

They built a close-knit community, looking out for one another and mourning one another after deadly fires. But they also decimated the Ballona Wetlands’ freshwater marsh with everything from battery acid to trash to human waste, and scared off nearby residents who once walked the trails.

And then one day, after almost three years, the encampment was gone, replaced by concrete barricades and metal fencing. The residents were mostly sent to interim housing and the RVs were mostly towed away.

“It’s like, hard to know what to think or feel,” Stephan told me. “I’m happy that the land is being stewarded, but just sad about the suffering that so many people face.”

She lamented the “fervent, anti-homeless mania” that she has heard from some of her neighbors.

“It’s just been really a painful time,” Stephan said.

L.A. City Councilmember Traci Park, whose Westside district includes the Ballona Wetlands and got elected on promises to aggressively crack down on homeless encampments, was more circumspect.

“At the end of the day, everybody wants the same thing, which is to get folks off the streets and into safe settings and connected to the help that they need,” she said while watching volunteers dig holes. “There’s a lot of different points of view about how we get there. And I think that’s where a lot of the conflict and the division lie.”

30,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"After a year in office, L.A. County sheriff talks deputy gangs, jail deaths, overdoses",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-10/after-a-year-in-office-l-a-county-sheriff-talks-deputy-gangs-jail-deaths-overdoses,"L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna attends a Hall of Justice news conference in 2022 to discuss the dangers of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and the launch an innovative public awareness campaign using a PSA film titled “Bad Meds.”

By the time Sheriff Robert Luna ousted his predecessor and became L.A. County’s top cop in late 2022, the nation’s largest sheriff’s department was awash in controversy.

The half-century-old problem of deputy gangs had brought the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department under increasing national scrutiny. Jail conditions were becoming increasingly dire, and the decades-old lawsuits about them seemed no closer to resolution. On top of that, the department was short on staff, mired in scandal and often at odds with county leaders.

A year later, many of those problems remain unresolved — and critics say the new sheriff has little to show for his time in office. The department has yet to ban deputy gang tattoos, and the courts have stymied efforts to identify the gangs’ alleged members. County data show roughly 20% of sworn positions are effectively vacant, jail death rates are soaring and, in June, the county only narrowly avoided a contempt hearing over conditions inside its lockups.

Still, the signs of change are unmistakable. After taking office, Luna quickly opened up more access to oversight officials. He created the Office of Constitutional Policing to help the county comply with four federal consent decrees, eradicate gangs and overhaul policies that could help reform the department.

So far this year, deputy-involved shootings are down , and the jail population is falling. Deputies are using force against inmates less frequently, and the department created a timer system to make sure jailers stopped chaining mentally ill people to benches for days. And this week, in an interview at the Hall of Justice, Luna told The Times he’s formulating a plan to close the county’s oldest lockup.

“Men’s Central Jail needs to be replaced,” he said. “We need something that resembles a care campus that can deal with what custody should look like toward the future.”

Exactly how that would work is still fuzzy, and the sheriff would only promise more details in the future, hinting at something perhaps loosely inspired by the gentler prison systems of European countries. Making that a reality will be an uphill battle — just like some of the other lofty goals Luna has in mind.

“For a sheriff’s department or a police department to be successful, we need to be properly led and properly partnered, staffed, equipped and trained,” he said. “I was handed a department that has been deficient. ... And we have a lot of work to do. A lot of work.”

Over a little more than an hour, Luna explained what some pieces of that work could entail. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

One of the issues that was pretty central in your campaign was eradicating deputy gangs. A year later, there’s still not a strong anti-gang policy in place. Why is that?

Advertisement

During the campaign I talked about deputy gangs. I raised my hand and said, “We have a problem.” So I’m admitting there’s an issue. That’s why we started the Office of Constitutional Policing. But remember this: any time we’re dealing with employees’ hours, working conditions or things that impact people’s daily lives, we have to go through a meet-and-confer process. When we started to draft the policy — although the Civilian Oversight Commission gave us their version of it — we still had to go through it and make sure that it was something that could work.

So [Office of Constitutional Policing director] Eileen Decker not only had to go through the Civilian Oversight Commission and the Office of Inspector General, but also the federal monitors. Once that was done, there were unofficial conversations going on with the different labor organizations. And then, I want to say sometime in October-ish, we gave it to them in a formal manner. That’s when it becomes official.

This problem has existed for 50 years. I’ve been in office now for a year. I want to fix this. That is my goal. Yes, it is taking a little bit longer than I would like to see, but our labor organizations have been good partners at the table. We don’t agree on everything, but I think we’re going to get to a good place.

Do you think you’ll have a new anti-gang policy in place at some point in this next year, during your second year in office?

That is my absolute expectation.

There was a widely criticized incident in Palmdale, where a deputy punched a woman with an infant in her arms. Can you tell me anything about if you’re making changes to policies about when deputies can punch civilians?

It’s still being worked out. But from my perspective, if one of my deputies is getting his butt kicked and it’s a fisticuffs, you have a right to defend yourself. And if you have to use personal weapons — punching somebody in the face — to do that, then you have to defend yourself. I would not take that very valuable tool away from our employees.

But if you have a suspect who is not fighting you but only resisting, that’s where I draw the line and say that you don’t just start punching people. I get it, sometimes it’s very difficult to handcuff people. And historically that has been allowed here and that’s what is catching a lot of employees off guard. The miscommunication is [they think], “Oh, he just wants to take it away from us.” No, there’s a time and place for it. Because when you’re using force on an individual, it’s to gain control, not to punish. There’s a difference there.

Was the incident in Palmdale what prompted you to evaluate the policies about punching people?

It was one of many things. We’ve had several incidents over the last year where personal weapons were used to overcome resistance, not in a fight.

According to a recent letter sent from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Board of Supervisors , the Sheriff’s Department has been finding uses of force against jail inmates to be within policy more than 98% of the time. But the federal court-appointed monitors agree only about two-thirds of the time. How do you explain that discrepancy?

I was told about that ACLU report probably about three or four hours ago. We’re making inquiries about if there is actually a discrepancy. But there are definitely challenges. When we’re talking about use of force, the federal monitors have said they don’t like the fact that they believe that our front-line supervisors are not holding employees accountable. So we are currently looking at that.

But as I’m talking to all of our supervisors, I’m talking about accountability. We have to be courageous and identify challenges that we’re having because that negatively impacts public trust and credibility. And honestly, it’s hanging our employees out to dry. Because if you’re not taking corrective actions or showing people that this is wrong, then other employees won’t believe it’s wrong.

A lot of the employees that I talk to when I visit stations, they’re frustrated with me because there’s been instances where people have been disciplined and they believe that you’re holding us to this standard, but yet you’re not providing the required training to get us there. So I’m doing an evaluation on our training — but I don’t need an evaluation to tell me we’re deficient.

One of the other issues with the jails has been the high death toll. As of today, the jails are a couple deaths away from having the highest death rate in at least 15 years. Why do you think that is?

Every time I see a notification that somebody dies in our custody, it’s like, “What the heck?” You don’t want to see any. I don’t want anything to go wrong while they’re in our custody.

I think there is a perception that people who are dying in our custody are dying due to force incidents or murders. Now, once in a while you will get somebody who does get murdered in our facility. This last year we attributed nine deaths to overdoses. And there are nine other autopsies that are still pending, but a lot of these cases look like they’re from natural causes.

A lot of the people that we take into custody, they’re probably getting the best healthcare they may have ever received in their entire life while they’re with us, which means that rarely does somebody go see a doctor. Then when they get to us, you get people who are ill, fall ill and then they end up dying in our custody. So if I have nine overdoses, how do I reduce those?

Some facilities have tried to minimize opioid overdoses by expanding access to medication-assisted treatment that reduces the urge to get high. Historically, this is something that your department has not broadly used. Do you have any plans to expand that?

I want to dig a little deeper. If there is resistance, is it from our department? Is it from Correctional Health Services? Is there a reason? I’d like to know. We have already gotten more canines to do drug detection. We need better body scanners. We’re working through our CFO to try and figure out how we can do that. We believe that a lot of the drugs are coming in through mail.

I envision — and I’m already working on this — all of our custody facilities getting really good internet service so that I can get tablets in and eliminate mail. Can you imagine if I can give a family the ability to FaceTime, what that would do? There’s so many opportunities.

31,[California] https://www.latimes.com/california,"Gusty winds spark brush fires in Ventura and Riverside counties, triggering some evacuations",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-09/gusty-winds-spark-brush-fire-promoting-evacuations-in-ventura-county,"The South fire, fueled by Santa Ana winds, has burned more than 2,900 acres and triggered evacuations in the Somis area near Santa Paula.

Ventura County firefighters Saturday battled a brush fire fueled by Santa Ana winds that had burned more than 2,900 acres and triggered evacuations and road closures near the town of Somis.

The blaze, dubbed the South fire, was first reported about 9:38 a.m. on South Mountain near the 118 and 126 freeways, with initial reports indicating three to four aces in size.

By late morning, the wind-driven fire had ballooned to 300 acres, said Andrew Dowd, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. As of 8:30 a.m. Sunday., the blaze had grown to 2,944 acres and was 15% contained.

“Although the weather has lightened and the winds have lightened up here, we do expect crews to continue battling this blaze all throughout the evening, with hand crews, engine companies, dozers and helicopters with night-vision goggles in place to help us suppress this fire,” Dowd said in an evening video update shared on the social media platform X.

In an earlier update, Andy VanSciver, another Fire Department spokesman, said the blaze, which was initially burning on the south side of South Mountain, had crested the top of the mountain and was burning down toward the Santa Clara River.

Engine companies were providing structural protection at residents’ homes, VanSciver said.

Evacuation orders were issued in the south-side foothills for those on East La Loma Avenue and West La Loma Avenue; East Los Angeles Avenue; and Aggen Road and La Vista Avenue.

Evacuation warnings also were issued for the South Mission Rock Road area in Santa Paula and the Saticoy Country Club area.

A temporary evacuation shelter was established at Ventura Community College. Residents can contact the information hotline at (805) 465-6650.

Road closures are also in effect from West Los Angeles Avenue north to West La Loma Avenue. This includes La Vista and Walnut avenues and Price and Aggen roads. West La Loma Avenue east from La Vista Road is also closed.

As of 5:30 p.m., the county’s sheriff’s emergency services incident dashboard showed almost 51,000 customers potentially affected by Southern California Edison’s public safety power shutoffs. More than 5,000 households were left without power.

“This is happening amid Santa Ana conditions, but we have about 100 firefighters engaged in ... ground, air and hand crews,” Dowd said.

In Riverside County, firefighters were battling a vegetation fire reported shortly after 9 a.m. in the 51000 block of Ida Avenue in Cabazon.

The blaze had grown to 65 acres by early afternoon, according to social media updates from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Riverside County Fire Department. By 2:30 p.m., the fire had slowed and firefighters reported it was 15% contained.

“Firefighters will remain on scene throughout today and tonight continuing to work on building containment,” the post read.

The National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning until 3 p.m. Sunday for most of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Low humidity and northeast winds of 20-25 mph and gusts of 45 mph are expected at the site of the fire, said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the weather service in Oxnard.

High winds are expected in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys in L.A. County as well as portions of eastern Ventura County, according to the weather service. The strongest blasts will rip through mountain areas.

“We’re looking at low humidity, strong gusty winds, and that combination tends to create conditions where you can have rapidly spreading fires,” Sweet said.

Though Southern California’s wildfire season typically begins in late spring and runs through early fall, a December wildfire is still a risk.

In December 2017, a strong Santa Ana event helped spark the Thomas fire, which scorched more than 280,000 acres, destroyed more than 1,000 structures and killed two people. The fire is the eighth-largest in state history, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Assn.

35,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Airport spending continues at McKinney airport after failed bond. Here’s why,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/12/11/airport-spending-continues-at-mckinney-airport-after-failed-bond-heres-why/,"McKinney City Council recently approved spending up to $24.5 million on McKinney National Airport projects, causing some residents to question why the city continues to spend money on the airport after voters said no to a $200 million general obligation bond to fund a new terminal for commercial passenger service.

Mayor George Fuller said the answer is simple: The airport is an asset to the city that in many ways benefits the entire community, not just on taxes paid. And while these projects are general aviation improvements and cannot be used in the future for commercial air service, future commercial service is not out of the question.

“We make decisions based on dollars and [financial] sense period,” Fuller said during a Dec. 5 council work session meeting. “Every time someone comes up and makes a statement that voters told us no they don’t want the airport — I’ll be very clear, I’ll speak just for myself — that’s not at all what the voters said... The voters said very specifically that they do not authorize the issuance of $200 million worth of debt… I am committed to exploring what it might mean for commercial passenger service at McKinney National Airport in ways that it makes sense and does not indebt the city or the taxpayer — that’s off the table obviously.”

However, when the item for approving the sale of $24.5 million in certificates of obligation for a 39,000-square-foot corporate hangar and a U.S. Customs facility showed up on the City Council meeting agenda in November, residents pointed to concerns with the project taking taxpayers into more debt, highlighting that they said no to airport debt in May.

“It is a $24.5 million debt that we can’t afford, and I know it doesn’t have anything to do with the [commercial passenger service] bond, but it does” said resident Tammy Warren during the Nov. 7 City Council meeting. “We’ve said no to airport debt. We don’t want it. We can’t afford it... I think [issuing the $24.5 million] is going to put a really bad taste in people’s mouths right after the airport bond that failed.”

Airport revenue backs certificates

Assistant city manager Barry Shelton noted that the certificates of obligation are backed by airport revenues and will not fall to the responsibility of taxpayers unless it is needed.

Advertisement

To help clear any confusion and explain to the public the benefits of the airport, Shelton presented for over an hour outlining the history of the airport, airport budget and what revenues and expenses look like, how projects are funded and Council’s strategic plan to maximize economic potential of the airport during the Dec. 5 council meeting.

Council member Geré Feltus said she understands why people could be confused as to why there is still support for the airport from the Council after the May bond election, and hopes presentations like this one will start to “close that gap in understanding.”

Shelton highlighted that in 2013 the appraised value of assets at the airport was about $97.2 million, which generated about $2.37 million in tax revenue to the city, McKinney ISD, Collin County and Collin College combined. In 2023, the appraised value of assets at the airport exceeded $186 million, which generated $797,699 in tax revenue to the city and about $2.32 million in revenue to McKinney ISD.

Overall, McKinney National Airport (TKI) was responsible for 993 jobs, about $64.3 million in payroll and about $212.7 million in total economic output, according to a 2018 Texas aviation economic impact study from the Texas Department of Transportation.

Further, business personal property — which is taxed at the same rate as real property — at the airport in 2023 paid the equivalent taxes of 400 average single-family homes in McKinney, and the most valuable single aircraft based at TKI in 2023 paid the same property taxes as 35 average single-family homes, where the average taxable value of a single family home in McKinney in 2023 was $466,175.

Project cost estimates

Past projects at the airport like the reconstruction of the ramp in January 2017 provided space for increased transient aircraft traffic. In 2023, transient aircraft utilizing that space brought in $1,487,253 in net fuel sales and services. Later, the Corporate 9 Hangar was constructed and revenues from it totaled $1,021,964 in 2023, including lease, net fuel sales and services.

In addition to approving the sale of $24.5 million in certificates of obligation in November, council approved executing a grant agreement with The Texas Department of Transportation to accept about $6.43 million and about $2.21 million in federal grants for the realignment and rehabilitation of Taxiway Alpha on Dec. 5. This involved amending the previously approved fiscal year 2024 budget to include the additional funds.

Advertisement

Project costs for Phase I of the Taxiway Alpha project are estimated to be $9,596,900, and the city will be responsible for 10% of the total project costs estimated at $959,690. The city’s portion of the project will come from the Airport Construction Fund which is typically funded as part of the city’s annual budget process and can include grants from state and federal programs, among other sources.

“As fiduciaries, it’s our job to maximize the value of the city assets and that’s what we’re endeavoring to do,” said Councilmember Patrick Cloutier at the conclusion of the meeting."

No. 1 box office actress

Doris Day was the No. 1 female box office draw in the 1950s and 1960s. She sang. She acted in many movies and had her own TV show.

Advertisement

But she might never have known that all her money was gone if her third husband, Marty Melcher, hadn’t died.

Advertisement

With him gone, Day and her son Terry took ownership of Day’s financial records. What they found led to the unraveling of a financial cesspool and a decade-long legal battle followed religiously by her fans. The lawyer was Jerry Rosenthal, and the case was Day vs. Rosenthal.

A Hollywood lawyer, he once explained, is a “nursemaid for movie stars.”

“You do a lot more than handle their divorces. You’re a father confessor, a high finance wizard, a movie critic and a conscience.”

Advertisement

He had no conscience.

When the third husband died, Rosenthal had it set that he would receive 50% of everything she made. An outrageous cut of the action.

Day might as well have sang “what will be won’t be.”

Her son Terry Melcher took charge of the mess and immediately fought with Rosenthal.

Advertisement

According to Day’s autobiography, Doris Day, Her Own Story, Rosenthal told the son: ““You ask too many questions. Go home, Junior, and let me take care of this. Don’t worry. I’m running things. Just leave everything to me. Now go home.”

“That’s your answer?” the son asked.

“That’s it. When I need you, I’ll send for you.”

“Well, Jer, I’ll tell you how it is. You’re fired.”

Not a penny left

After the firing, it was likely the hardest conversation Melcher had with his mother. In her autography, her son recounts what he has learned.

“Mom, I’ve had a showdown with Rosenthal, and the bad news is – God, I wish I didn’t have to tell you – but the fact is, you don’t have anything. Not a penny. The hotels are bankrupt. All the oil wells are dry, and there aren’t any cattle.

“Nothing, Mom. And what’s even worse, you have a lot of debts – like around $450,000. Most of it is taxes. They have to be paid.”

Red flags ignored

Looking back, as always, the path to financial ruin was strewn with red flags.

Actor Kirk Douglas warned Day’s husband to steer clear of Rosenthal. Melcher responded by ending his friendship with the actor and never telling Day why.

Advertisement

Steering clear would have been difficult since Melcher’s office (he was Day’s manager) was next door to Rosenthal’s.

Another flag: when Day went to Rosenthal’s office to confront him, he started to explain to her the intricacies of tax shelters, she recalled later. Her eyes glazed over, and she tuned out.

The oil wells were gushing, he told her. She came away believing him that she had “a healthy income and a very favorable tax position.”

“Whatever that meant,” she wrote in her autobiography.

Advertisement

And when she wanted to divorce her husband, Rosenthal told her that would be impossible because all their finances were tied together and they would “lose everything.”

Looking back, it was clear that a divorce would have exposed his shenanigans.

How much did her husband know about the scam? That question was hotly debated. One comment from him to Day stands out: “You keep putting Rosenthal down, but he’s a genius and what he’s doing for you, you should write him a thank-you note every day.”

Hardly.

He possibly altered his opinion in the hospital before he died. When Rosenthal sent flowers, Melcher told a nurse, “Keep them out of here.”

He did his wife dirty. He and Rosenthal signed Day up for a five-year TV show. But they didn’t tell her. When CBS sent $500,000 for set design costs, Rosenthal fed the money into his pyramid scheme, and it never showed up again.

After more than a decade of legal battles, a judge ruled that Rosenthal owed Day $22 million, the biggest verdict ever in a California civil trial to that point. He also was disbarred as a lawyer.

The judge said, “The lawyer, when he receives his license to practice, is armed with the ability to do great and good things, but he also can commit great harm and mischief.”

Day didn’t get back much. But she got satisfaction.

Day’s biggest problem was she trusted her husband and her lawyer without verifying. If it can happen to the box office queen, it can happen to anyone.

Here are some themes to watch.

Paxton, Abbott target some GOP House incumbents

It’s common for Republican House incumbents to get challenges from hard-right insurgents. This season, however, features two of the state’s top leaders weighing in on March 5 contests.

Gov. Greg Abbott is pushing a slate of candidates who support developing a school voucher-like program in Texas. A school choice bill has failed in the House because of a coalition of some rural Republicans and Democrats. They rejected proposals for an education savings account plan that would have allowed public school students to tap into public dollars to attend private schools.

Abbott is making good on a vow to make school choice an issue in the primaries.

Attorney General Ken Paxton, who in September survived a Senate impeachment trial, is also a player in the primaries. Paxton is supporting candidates running against numerous House members who voted to impeach him. Those include members from Collin County, his hometown, as well as Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan of Beaumont.

Phelan is expected to use his resources to help protect House incumbents, so the March primaries should be interesting.

Democrats decide best approach against Ted Cruz

By the end of Monday, there will likely be double-digit candidates in the Democratic Party primary for Senate, where the winner will face Republican incumbent Ted Cruz in the November general election.

A top contender is U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, D-Dallas, who has a large lead in fundraising and is running as a business Democrat who stressed bipartisanship. His main rival for the nomination is state Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, who says he’s more progressive and doesn’t think the pursuit of bipartisanship is a worthwhile effort.

Campaign money and resources aside, the race could involve which style of leading is more favorable to primary voters, as all the candidates have similar views on most of the issues, though there are differences on border security. Allred says he favors building barriers along the southern border where they make sense, while Gutierrez is against such structures.

Supporters say Allred has a strong record of delivering for his district and Texas, including bringing a VA medical center to Garland, while Gutierrez said his unrelenting approach has helped the families of Uvalde, where 19 students and two teachers were killed in the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School.

Allred’s resources could be a key factor in the contest. For the cycle, he outraised Gutierrez by a 20-1 margin, and the task for everyone in the race is to have enough money to amplify their messages in a costly statewide market.

State Rep. Carl Sherman, D-DeSoto, is also mounting a Democratic primary campaign for Senate, hoping to sell voters on his experience as a lawmaker, former DeSoto mayor and minister.

No matter what happens in the March primaries and November general election, there will be three new lawmakers representing North Texas in Congress.

Incumbents not seeking reelection include the retiring Michael Burgess, R-Pilot Point, and Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth. Allred is leaving his House seat to run for Senate.

Granger is the powerful chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, so her departure means a loss of political clout. Burgess has represented District 26, including parts of Denton, Tarrant and Dallas counties, since 2003.

Allred has represented Democratic-leaning District 32 in parts of northern and eastern Dallas County since 2019. It was once a GOP stronghold.

38,[Texas] https://www.dallasnews.com/news/,Where to see the April 2024 total solar eclipse in the D-FW area,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/12/11/where-to-see-the-april-2024-total-solar-eclipse-in-the-d-fw-area/,"On April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will sweep across North America. Most of the Dallas-Fort Worth area is in the path of totality, giving residents the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch the moon block the sun for just under four minutes.

Are you in a prime location for eclipse viewing? It might be worth checking: Dallas won’t be in a solar eclipse’s path of totality again until 2317.

Where will the eclipse be visible in D-FW?

A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the Earth and sun, casting a shadow that can partially or totally block the sun’s light. The D-FW area witnessed a partial eclipse in October known as the “ring of fire,” but the total eclipse in April promises to be even more awe-inspiring. During totality, or the time when the moon appears to totally cover the sun, daylight will dim, temperatures may drop and stars could be visible in the midday sky.

On April 8, the eclipse will move from Mexico to the northeastern United States and Canada. Mexico’s Pacific Coast will be the first to experience totality, weather permitting, at 11:07 a.m. PT or 1:07 p.m. CT.

In Dallas, the moon will begin to cover the sun around 12:23 p.m., with totality beginning around 1:40 p.m. and ending just under 4 minutes later. The moon will then move away from the sun, with the spectacle ending around 3:02 p.m. Exact timing will depend on location in the metroplex.

Several Texas cities will be in the path of totality, including Dallas, most of Fort Worth, Waco, Temple, most of Austin and parts of San Antonio. Denton is outside the path of totality.

Those outside the path of totality will still see a partial eclipse, with the moon partially covering the sun. But experiencing totality is worth the effort, according to Mary Urquhart, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who witnessed it in Tennessee in 2017.

“It really was a profound experience for me,” said Urquhart. “I know it is for a lot of people. The changes in the environment can be quite dramatic.”

Advertisement

Cities closer to the middle of the path will experience a longer totality. Dallas is predicted to experience about 3 minutes and 52 seconds. Waco, closer to the midline, may experience about 4 minutes and 12 seconds.

For area residents within the path, Urquhart’s advice is to go outside and look up, avoiding tall buildings and trees for a clear view.

Several North Texas institutions, including the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and the Dallas Arboretum, will host eclipse viewing events. Tickets for the Arboretum are already on sale. Tickets for the Perot Museum go on sale Dec. 13 for museum members and Dec. 15 for non-members.

More events will be announced in the coming months.

Eclipse safety

Looking at a solar eclipse without eye protection is dangerous: the sun’s brightness can damage eyes in seconds. It’s safe to look at the eclipse without glasses during totality but not before or after.

Many online listings for eclipse glasses can be counterfeit, but a list of safe options is available on the American Astronomical Society’s website. Glasses should comply with the International Organization for Standardization’s safety guidelines. (A note on the back of the glasses should say they meet ISO 12312-2 requirements.) Sunglasses are not protective enough.

Area residents can also view the eclipse indirectly by poking a hole through cardboard, using a colander or holding a cracker to project the image of the eclipse onto the ground or a sheet of paper, Urquhart said.

Arlan Burnham, a fourth-grader at West Creek Elementary School, was found dead under debris when his Clarksville home collapsed Saturday, his mother announced on Facebook.

“My beautiful baby boy, Arlan, did not make it out of the house,” Katherine Burnham wrote, noting that her home is gone” after being in the “direct path of [the] tornado.”

“I can not put into words how absolutely devastated I am.”

Arlan and his older sister, Ella, were both trapped under debris.

While a neighbor, Billy Urban, managed to pull both out, only the girl survived, escaping with superficial injuries, Clarksville Now reports.

“My son was amazing,” the grieving mom told the outlet. “There is no one in this world like him. Anyone that has ever encountered him is experiencing a loss.”

Her husband, Kyle, also posted on Facebook that “our entire family was turned upside down” by the tornado.

“Kyle and I are not OK,” the mom stressed in her post.

“We don’t know how to navigate through this, we have no idea what is next,” she said. “Anyone who knows me at all knows how much I love and adore my kids, all kids really.”

A family friend has since set up an online fundraiser, to raise money for the Burnham family to rebuild their homes and pay for Arlan’s funeral expenses.

“The road to recovery will be long and arduous, both emotionally and financially,” it reads.

“The Burnham family is now faced with the overwhelming task of rebuilding their lives from scratch.

“As they navigate through the grief of losing a cherished family member, they also must contend with the daunting challenge of reconstructing their home and replacing the essentials that were lost in the tornado.

“Let us come together as a community to show Kyle Burnham and his family that they are not alone in their struggle,” the GoFundMe says, noting: “Your generosity will provide them with the strength and resources needed to begin the healing process and rebuild their lives in the wake of this heartbreaking tragedy.”

As of Monday morning, the fundraiser had already netted more than $85,000 for the family — 17 times more than the $5,000 it requested.

The family is also asking for clothing donations.

Two other adults who died in Clarksville have not yet been identified.

Also killed in the powerful storms were Joseph Dalton, 37; Floridana Gabriel Perez, 31; and Perez’s 2-year-old son, Anthony Elmer Mendez.

Perez’s other son, 7, and Dalton’s 10-year-old son, had both been inside their respective homes at the time and were taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

In total, 83 people were injured and 23 are being treated at local hospitals."

The president, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend the reception. Hanukkah continues through Friday.

The Biden administration in May announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism.

That laid out more than 100 actions, including a series of steps to raise awareness and understanding of antisemitism and the threat it poses around the U.S.

Still, antisemitism has only intensified in some quarters since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants sparked Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged its members to demand an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.

The Biden administration supported a since-expired, temporary pause in the fighting as Hamas released some of the hostages it held in Gaza, and is pushing for another truce — but the fighting continues in the meantime.

The husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, Emhoff is the first Jewish person to be the spouse of one of the country’s nationally elected leaders.

On Saturday, Liz Magill, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, resigned amid pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.

Universities across the US have been accused of failing to protect Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from the war in Gaza."

One search warrant executed Wednesday at the Natural Bridge Zoo in Rockbridge County shows that 89 living animals were seized, while another 28 deceased animals were removed, The Roanoke Times reported.

The office of Attorney General Jason Miyares is conducting the investigation, with help from the Virginia State Police.

The warrant said that it had been issued in relation to the care of and cruelty to animals.

The attorney general’s “Animal Law Unit offers support and prosecution of animal cruelty cases upon request of a local Commonwealth’s Attorney or law enforcement agency,” Miyares spokesperson Victoria LaCivita said in an email Friday. “Because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, we cannot comment further.”

LaCivita did confirm that one of the dead animals taken was a tiger that had to be euthanized with consent of the owners to humanely end its suffering.

Other live animals that were taken away included lemurs, macaws, pythons and llamas, according to the warrant, filed Friday in the county’s circuit court.

Many crates and animal carriers were taken into the zoo.

A phone call to Natural Zoo Bridge went unanswered Saturday, and there was no immediate response to an email seeking comment.

The zoo has already been closed for the winter.

Mario Williams, an attorney for the zoo’s owner, questioned the probe, telling WDBJ-TV earlier in the week that the zoo would seek to halt any permanent seizure of the animals, which he said would be unconstitutional."

Jonathan Garzia-Martinez, 17, is currently serving a minimum of 16 years of a 40-year prison sentence after being found guilty in June for the vile assault on his former El Dorado High School teacher in April 2022.

Nearly two years after the attack, disturbing footage obtained by 8 News Now shows the events of the life-changing day.

Surveillance footage inside the high school shows Martinez-Garcia, then 16, wandering the halls at 1:33 p.m. on April 7, 2022.

He’s seen attempting to open a classroom door near the end of the hall but fails and starts to walk away.

Suddenly, his teacher — identified only as Sade — pops her head out of the room, and Martinez-Garcia quickly turns around and approaches the classroom.

The footage then cuts to the unhinged teen struggling with his teacher before he violently drags her back into the classroom.

The video jumps to 3:05 p.m., nearly an hour and a half after the teen launched his attack, walking out of the classroom with his head down.

The footage then changes to the Bodycam of a Clark County School District Police hunting down Garcia-Martinez later that day after the reports came in of the attack.

“Possible suspect sighting, he sees the suspect right outside of his residence right now,” the officer, who eventually arrested Garcia-Martinez, hears over the radio.

The teen was sitting in a tinted-out vehicle as the arresting officer approached.

“Hey, driver turn the car off. Turn the car off. Jonathan steps out of the car,” the CCSDPD officer commands, adding, “You know why we’re here?”

Now changed into his high school’s ROTC uniform, Gacia-Martinez exits the car and calmly says, “No” before the video ends.

During his June 2023 sentencing, the severity of his despicable acts was revealed after his teacher gave a harrowing statement while Gacia-Martinez was seen smirking during the hearing.

“Since it happened there hasn’t been a single night I haven’t dreamt of the attack,” Sade shared.

“I would wake up in a new spot and position each time knowing that he’d just drag my limp, and near lifeless body to a different part of the classroom to do whatever he so chose to do with my body, as I lay unconscious.”

“He’d beat my body so badly that I could no longer fight,” she said.

Sade told police that she came to and asked why he was attacking her, with his chilling response being he “didn’t like teachers,” so he was “getting revenge.”

The teen then choked her unconscious, and when she awoke, her pants and underwear had been pulled down while he was pouring liquid over her.

Investigators revealed that Sade said he was going to “set something on fire” before toppling a heavy bookshelf over her and sitting down on top of it while he tried slashing her wrists.

“I was being crushed to near death,” she explained.

“Sade remembers him saying, ‘Why won’t you just die?’” Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney William Rowles shared with the court during sentencing.

Garcia previously pleaded guilty to attempted murder, battery with use of a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm, and attempted sexual assault.

The teen claimed he “blacked out” during the attack but later told police he raped his teacher and remembered trying to strangle her.

“I regret what I’ve done,” Gacia-Martinez told the court in June.

“I also regret the things I should have done, but didn’t do.”

Though he apologized, his attorney argued an asthma drug he was taking called Singulair, also known as Montelukast, caused severe mood swings and delusions and is the focus of a number of lawsuits over severe mental health problems users have experienced.

“He had no history of anything but being a perfect loving kid,” his attorney, public defender Tyler Gaston, argued to the court.

Disagreeing with Gaston, Judge Kathleen Delaney wasn’t buying it and harshly sentenced the teen to 40 years in prison.

“It is the most heinous type of crime there could be,” she said."

“The atrocities that we saw on Oct. 7 are almost beyond description or beyond our capacity to digest,” Blinken said in a Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.

“And we’ve talked about them before, but the sexual violence that we saw on Oct. 7 is beyond anything that I’ve ever seen, either.”

The failure to condemn, and in some cases failure to even believe, the reports of sexual violence is something about which “these organizations, these countries need to ask themselves.”

Blinken was asked whether he thought the UN’s stalled acknowledgment was due to antisemitism.

“I don’t know why countries, leaders, international organizations were so slow to focus on this, to bring it to people’s attention,” Blinken responded. “I’m glad it is finally happening.”

Blinken said the widespread sexual violence committed by Hamas is “beyond anything I’ve ever seen.” CNN

Reports of widespread rape in Israel during Hamas’ attack were first reported last month, when the Physicians for Human Rights Israel published its initial assessment.

“What we know for sure is that it was more than just one case and it was widespread, in that this happened in more than one location and more than a handful of times,” Hadas Ziv, the group’s policy and ethics director said.

One combat medic also told the Associated Press how he came across at least a half dozen bodies of women and men with possible signs of sexual assault.

The bodies had mass bleeding around the groins, he said, with limbs distorted at odd angles.

Israeli police say they are now combing through some 60,000 videos seized from terrorists’ body cameras, from social media and from security cameras, as well as 1,000 testimonies to bring the perpetrators to justice.

But it has been difficult to find the rape survivors, as many had been killed afterward.

At first, several lawmakers questioned the reports, and Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal even called for “balanced” criticism when asked about the rapes.

But House Democrats are now planning to introduce a resolution condemning Hamas’ use of rape against Israeli women as a weapon of war.

Meanwhile, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it requested access to Israel and the Palestinian territories to allow it to collect information about the events of Oct. 7, but a spokesperson said Israel has not responded to the requests.

The Jewish nation has previously said the UN has preexisting biases and will not cooperate with the body.

49,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"What did you Google in 2023? ‘Barbie,’ Israel-Hamas war are among the year’s top internet searches",https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/what-did-you-google-in-2023-barbie-israel-hamas-war-are-among-the-years-top-internet-searches/,"Your Google search history for 2023 has arrived.

Well, actually, the world’s. On Monday, the California-based tech giant released its “Year in Search,” a roundup of 2023’s top global queries, ranging from unforgettable pop culture moments (hello, Barbenheimer ), to the loss of beloved figures and tragic news carrying worldwide repercussions.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war topped news trends in 2023, per Google’s global data, followed by queries related to the Titanic-bound submersible that imploded in June, as well as February’s devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

Damar Hamlin was Google’s top trending person on search this year.

A safety with the NFL’s Buffalo Bills, Hamlin experienced a near-death cardiac arrest on the field during a January game, but has since completed a celebrated comeback.

Actor Jeremy Renner, who survived a serious snowplow accident at the start of 2023, followed. Meanwhile, the late Matthew Perry and Tina Turner led search trends among notable individuals who passed away.

In the world of entertainment, “Barbie” dominated Google search’s movie trends this year — followed by Barbenheimer co-pilot “Oppenheimer” and Indian thriller “Jawan.”

In TV, “The Last of Us,” “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia” were the top three trending shows in 2023.

Yoasobi’s “アイドル (Idol)” was Google’s top trending song on search.

Jason Aldean’s “Try That In A Small Town” — which soared in the charts after controversy this summer — and Shakira and Bizarrap’s “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” followed.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg for Google’s 2023 global search trends. Bibimbap was the top trending recipe. Inter Miami CF, the new home of Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi, led Google’s sports teams trends.

And in the U.S. specifically, many consumers spent 2023 asking why eggs, Taylor Swift tickets and sriracha bottles were so expensive — while “rizz” (recently named Oxford’s word of the year ) was a frontrunner for trending slang definition inquires.

You can find more data, including country-specific lists and trends from years past, on Google’s “Year in Search” archive.

The company says it collected its 2023 search results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 27 of this year.

Google isn’t the only one to publish annual data as 2023 draws to a close — and from dictionary lookups to music streams, chances are, you’ve probably seen other lists recapping online activity this year.

Last week, for example, Wikipedia released its year-end list of most-viewed entries — with its article about ChatGPT leading the pack.

To mark the search engine’s 25th birthday, Google also released top search data “of all time” across various specific categories.

Since 2004 (when the company’s trends data first became available globally), the most-Googled Grammy winner of all time has been Beyoncé, for example, while Portuguese soccer great Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest-searched athlete, and the most-searched movie or TV cast is “Harry Potter.”"
50,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Israel battles militants in Gaza’s main cities, with civilians still stranded near front lines",https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/israel-battles-militants-in-gazas-main-cities-with-civilians-still-stranded-near-front-lines/,"Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants in Gaza’s two largest cities on Monday, with civilians still sheltering along the front lines even after massive waves of displacement across the besieged territory.

Israel has pledged to keep fighting until it removes Hamas from power, dismantles its military capabilities and returns all of the scores of hostages still held by Palestinian militants after being captured during the Oct. 7 surprise attack into Israel that ignited the war.

The US has provided unwavering diplomatic and military support for the campaign, even as it has urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties and further mass displacement.

The war has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and driven nearly 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes.

Residents said there was heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli ground forces opened a new line of attack last week, and battles were still underway in parts of Gaza City and the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, where large areas have been reduced to rubble.

“The situation is extremely difficult,” said Hussein al-Sayyed, who is staying with relatives in Khan Younis after fleeing Gaza City earlier in the war. “I have children and I don’t know where to go. No place is safe.”

He and his three daughters are staying in a three-story home with around 70 others, most of whom have fled from the north, and said they have been rationing food for days. “Over many days, I have eaten just one meal a day to save food for the girls. They are still young,” he said.

Another Khan Younis resident, Radwa Abu Frayeh, witnessed heavy Israeli strikes around the European Hospital, where the UN humanitarian office says tens of thousands of people have sought shelter. She said a strike hit a home close to hers late Sunday.

“The building shook,” she said. “We thought it was the end and we would die.”

FEARS OF PERMANENT DISPLACEMENT

With very little aid allowed in, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods.

Some observers openly worry that Palestinians will be forced out of Gaza altogether in a repeat of the mass exodus from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

“Expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a forum in Qatar, a key intermediary, on Sunday.

Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, called allegations that Israeli intends mass displacement from Gaza “outrageous and false.”

But other Israeli officials have discussed such a scenario, raising alarm in Egypt and other friendly Arab countries that refuse to accept any refugees.

At the same time, it’s not clear when or if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza City and much of the north — home to some 1.2 million before the war — where entire neighborhoods have been flattened.

The fighting in and around Khan Younis threatens to bring similar destruction to the south, and has already pushed tens of thousands toward the town of Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt.

It has also hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid to most of Gaza, putting even more pressure on people to head south.

HARSH CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, saying it endangers residents by fighting in dense areas and positioning military infrastructure — including weapons, tunnels and rocket launchers — in or near civilian buildings.

The military said Sunday that troops killed armed men as they left a clinic, and that forces operating in Jabaliya found a truck full of long-range rockets near a school.

In a home in Jabaliya, soldiers found a rifle, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and explosives, it said.

Israel has urged people to flee to what it says are safe areas in the south but has continued to strike alleged militant targets throughout the territory.

Associated Press reporters saw nine bodies brought to a local hospital on Monday after an airstrike hit a home in Rafah overnight.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said people in the south are also falling ill as they pack into crowded shelters or sleep in tents in open areas.

Nicholas Papachrysostomou, MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, said “every other patient” at a clinic in Rafah has a respiratory infection after prolonged exposure to cold and rain.

“In some shelters, 600 people share a single toilet. We are already seeing many cases of diarrhea. Often children are the worst affected,” he said.

With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,900, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory.

The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Some 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed during the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas and other militants also captured more than 240 people, including babies, women and older adults.

More than 100 captives were released during a weeklong cease-fire late last month in exchanges for women and minors held in Israeli prisons.

Israel says Hamas still has 117 hostages and the remains of 20 people killed in captivity or during the Oct. 7 attack.

Most remaining hostages are soldiers and civilian men, and the militants hope to exchange them for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

The military says 101 Israeli soldiers have died since the start of the Gaza ground offensive.

Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets at Israel, though the vast majority have been intercepted or landed in open areas without causing casualties or damage."

The body of 17-year-old Brandon Smith was discovered Sunday but details surrounding his “untimely” death, including the cause, remain unclear.

“We are heartbroken to hear the news of the tragic and untimely death of one of our student-athletes, Brandon Smith,” Manchester Schools Superintendent Robert Griffin and Manchester High School Principal Suze Neal said in a joint statement posted on the school’s website.

“Manchester High School’s celebration of playing for the Georgia 1-A State Football Championship has unfortunately turned into something none of us could have fathomed.”

The school leaders said the tragedy was being probed with more information expected to be released by the authorities.

A scene tied to the death was being investigated by police Sunday afternoon, 11 Alive reported. The student was reported missing on Saturday, according to the station.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation confirmed to WRBL that it was assisting Manchester police with the “crime scene processing.”

“We continue to pray for Brandon’s family, friends, teammates, and classmates,” Griffin and Neal wrote, adding. “Brandon was a loyal teammate and friend who excelled on and off the field. He will be deeply missed.”

The crash happened the night of Dec. 6 on I-275 at the Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, according to Florida Highway Patrol.

Troopers responded to assist Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office deputies regarding a stolen Ford Mustang that they had unsuccessfully attempted to stop.

The driver, identified as 22-year-old Leosvany Roman, allegedly crashed into two HCSO vehicles before fleeing the scene, the sheriff’s office said.

According to FHP, Roman led officers on a chase in which he collided with an FHP trooper’s vehicle, then turned around, rammed the vehicle again, then sped off before hitting a Dodge Caravan head-on.

The driver, who FHP confirmed was an Uber operator, was pronounced dead at the scene along with one of three passengers, with a second passenger later dying at a hospital from her injuries.

“This criminal had no regard for human life. Our deputies, facing danger, had to jump out of the way of a man they feared would run them over to get away,” HCSO Sheriff Chad Chronister said. “The additional charges he faces will ensure the only road he’s ever on again is the one that leads straight to jail.”

The Dodge driver was identified as a 33-year-old man from Bradenton, Florida. The passenger who died at the scene is said to be a 52-year-old man from Ohio.

FHP said they could not confirm whether the Dodge driver was on duty for Uber at the time.

Uber said in a statement to Fox News Digital that they have no record of the trip, and that the crash “does not appear to be connected to the Uber platform.”

A 24-year-old passenger from Ohio was last said to have suffered a serious injury, and a 27-year-old trooper who is a two-year veteran with the department, also suffered minor injuries as a result of the incident, FHP said.

Roman is charged with felony murder, vehicular homicide, aggravated fleeing and eluding involving death, driving while license suspended involving death and battery on a law enforcement officer."

“[The Detroit Police Department] can confirm that a person of interest has been taken into custody in furtherance of the investigation into the murder of Samantha Woll,” the department said in a statement to The Post.

“In an effort to ensure the integrity of this ongoing investigation, no further details will be released at this time. Additional information will be released in the near future.”

Woll, the president of the Isaac Agree Downtown Detroit Synagogue, was found stabbed to death outside of her home on October 21.

A suspect was taken into custody in November but was later released without being charged.

The latest possible suspect, an unidentified man, was not an acquaintance of Woll and appears to be a total stranger, the Detroit News reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation.

The man detained Sunday is also not the same person who was taken into custody last month, sources confirmed to the newspaper.

Woll, 40, was killed as the US has faced a wave of antisemitism following the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict, but authorities have stressed the slaying was not driven by hate.

The sources also told Detroit News Sunday there is no evidence her homicide was a hate crime.

Woll was at a wedding in the hours leading up to her murder. Police believe she was stabbed inside her home before stumbling outside.

The 911 call reporting an unresponsive person at her address came in around 6:30 a.m., cops said. Woll had left the wedding at about 123:30 a.m., according to friends and police."
54,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Movement to give ‘nature’ same rights as humans gains steam in US,https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/movement-to-give-nature-same-rights-as-humans-gains-steam-in-us/,"Legislation that grants nature similar rights to humans is becoming more popular across the globe, with multiple countries and localities approving nature rights laws and several more considering similar legislation.

Panama, Ecuador and Bolivia have all moved to recognize the rights of nature with national legislation, a movement that has gained traction around the world and in the United States, with 10 states having some form of legal protections for nature, according to a report by CBS News.

The most recent country to join the movement was Panama, where the new law was used to shut down one of the largest copper mines in the world.

Behind the effort in that country was Callie Veelenturf, a 31-year old American marine biologist from Massachusetts who has spent much of her career studying and advocating for the protection of sea turtles.

But a legal battle to protect herself from sexual harassment in 2018 became a turning point for Veelenturf, who realized nature did not have the same legal recourse she had as a human.

“I realized that we can’t defend the rights of nature as I had just defended my rights, because nature largely has no rights in our legal systems,” Veelenturf told CBS News.

The marine biologist said a book, “The Rights of Nature: A Legal Revolution That Could Save the World,” helped solidify the idea in her mind, causing her to make it “a mission” to advance the concept across the globe.

“It prioritizes the needs of the ecosystems and not the needs of humanity,” Veelenturf said.

“I realized that we can’t defend the rights of nature as I had just defended my rights, because nature largely has no rights in our legal systems,” Callie Veelenturf said. Callie Veelenturf

The marine biologist brought the idea to Panama’s first lady and parliament, where it gained widespread support and eventually became law.

The law has since been used by the country’s Supreme Court to shut down a $10 billion copper mine that opponents claimed would threaten tropical jungles and water supplies.

In the U.S., Seattle recently recognized the rights of salmon to pass through the city’s dams, according to the CBS News report, while North Carolina has begun considering giving rights to the Haw River ecosystem.

The trend has been encouraging to Veelenturf, who argued humans need “a different way of interacting with nature.”

“It’s just exciting every time. It never gets old,” Veelenturf said. “What we’re doing now is obviously not working, and so this provides a different way of interacting with nature. I think we’re at a point now where it’s worth a shot.”"
55,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Divers recover the seventh of 8 crew members killed in crash of a US military Osprey off Japan,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/divers-recover-the-seventh-of-8-crew-members-killed-in-crash-of-a-us-military-osprey-off-japan/,"Divers on Sunday recovered the remains of the seventh of the eight crew members from a US military Osprey aircraft that crashed off southern Japan during a training mission.

The Air Force CV-22 Osprey went down Nov. 29 just off Yakushima Island in southwestern Japan while on its way to Okinawa.

The bodies of six of the crew had since been recovered, including five from the sunken wreckage of the aircraft.

The US Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement that the body found by Air Force divers was one of the two crew members still missing.

The identity of the airman had been determined but the information was being withheld until next of kin could be notified, the command said.

“Currently there is a combined effort in locating and recovering the remains of our eighth airman,” it said.

A week after the crash and repeated reminders from the Japanese government about safety concerns, the US military grounded all its Osprey V-22 aircraft after a preliminary investigation indicated something went wrong with the craft that was not a human error.

The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster, like an airplane, during flight.

The crash raised new questions about the safety of the Osprey, which has been involved in multiple fatal accidents over its relatively short time in service.

Japan grounded its fleet of 14 Ospreys after the crash.

Japanese defense officials say Ospreys are key to the country’s military buildup especially in southwestern Japan, in the face of a growing threat from China.

But the crash has rekindled worries and public protests in areas where additional Osprey deployment is planned.

Japanese residents and media have criticized Japan’s government for not pushing hard enough to get Ospreys grounded sooner or gain access to information about the crash."

The unidentified man’s legs became pinned beneath a boulder in an accident while he was hiking the Inyo Mountains on Tuesday afternoon, according to Inyo County Search & Rescue — which was called to respond.

Nine volunteer crew members made their way out to the stranded hiker below the Santa Rita Flat via helicopter and four-wheel drive vehicles, arriving well after dark, the rescue team said.

They found the hiker “in great pain with his left leg pinned beneath a large boulder on a steep hillside.”

They estimated the boulder crushing his leg weighed between 6,000 and 10,000 pounds, Inyo County Search & Rescue said.

The rescue team crafted “a system of ropes, pulleys, and leverage” to shift the giant rock just enough to free the man’s leg. They then assessed his crushed leg and stabilized the injury until medics arrived via helicopter.

“Due to the seriousness of the hiker’s injuries and the difficulty of the terrain, it was decided to extricate the hiker despite the darkness using a helicopter from US Naval Air Station Lemoor,” Inyo County Search & Rescue said.

The helicopter was unable to land due to the hilly terrain so a US Navy medic rappelled down to the injured hiker and both were hoisted up into the aircraft.

The hiker was flown to a hospital in Fresno for treatment after midnight.

The Inyo County Search & Rescue crew members headed out of the mountains and signed off at 4 a.m.

The team said the difficult mission included several challenges along the way including “coordination of multiple agencies and resources; accessing an accident scene in steep, loose rocky terrain; using limited resources to move a large boulder; managing a severely injured patient for several hours while awaiting the helicopter extrication; assisting in a nighttime helicopter hoist; all in chilly December darkness.”

The nonprofit did not provide an update on the hiker’s condition."
57,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,California coffee shop fires antisemitic employees who blocked Jewish customer from using bathroom,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/california-coffee-shop-fires-employees-involved-in-antisemitic-behavior-towards-jewish-customer/,"Three employees at a California coffee shop who were seen blocking a Jewish woman from using the bathroom while making anti-Israel comments in a now-viral video are now out of a java job.

Amy and Chris Hillyard, the owners of Farley’s East in Oakland, posted on social media Sunday that the employees seen on the video berating the customer “was shocking and unacceptable” and they are now jobless due to their actions.

“We do not tolerate any behavior at Farley’s that makes people feel unwelcome or unsafe. Because this act was not aligned with our values, the employees involved in the incident are no longer employed by Farley’s,” the Hillyards posted on the shop’s social media.

“Events like these strike fear in the Jewish community and perpetuate the rise of anti-Semitism in our community and around the world.”

“We can and must do better — and this starts with us creating a safe space for anyone who patronizes our coffeehouse.”

The video, recorded by the customer, showed three of its employees blocking the woman from using the shop’s restroom.

6 The owners stated that acts of hate would not be tolerated in their business.

6 One worker tells the woman, “I know Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own.”

The customer, who claims to have gone into the bathroom beforehand and noticed antisemitic graffiti written on the mirror saying, “Zionism = fascism” and “Your neutrality/apathy is enabling genocide” scribbled on a diaper-changing station, was attempting to re-enter to document the remarks when the employees prevented her.

One of the employees started telling the customer the café was “private property” and she needed to leave.

Stay on top of news out of the Israel-Hamas war and the global surge in antisemitism with The Post’s Israel War Update, delivered right to your inbox every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

As the customer stands her ground, insisting on using the public restroom, another employee says, “I know Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own, but we got to head [out],” while gesturing his hand toward the door.

The customer tells the employees she is a “patron” at the shop and has a “right” to use the bathroom, but the male employee doubles down and tells her they “have a right to refuse service.”

As the customer goes back and forth with the Farley’s employees, a woman who works at a neighboring business offers her the use of its bathroom.

“I should not be excluded when other people are allowed,” she tells the employee from the neighboring business.

6 “Your neutrality/apathy is enabling genocide” scribbled on a diaper-changing station

One of the coffee shop employees tells her she can “use the other restroom” in the café, but the customer insists on using the one with the graffiti.

“All you’re going to get is a video of us saying that ‘Zionism is antisemitism’ because it is,” says the employee.

“If you agree with [the graffiti], why are you afraid that I take a picture of it?” the customer responds.

6 A woman who works at a neighboring business offered the Jewish café patron the use of its bathroom next door.

The staff suddenly gives in and allows the patron into the bathroom.

As she enters to film the bathroom, the male employee rudely claims that “history didn’t start in 1948, lady,” seemingly referring to the year in which Israel was established.

“Free Palestine. Now please go,” one of the staffers chimes in, as the male employee repeats the phrase, adding, “It’s always … great, we LOVE it.”

The employees also accused the woman of “misgendering” an employee during the altercation.

The video gained more than 2.6 million views when it was posted Tuesday by StopAntisemitism.

Before the three employees were fired, Farley’s issued an apology Thursday after growing outrage from the viral video.

“The staff handled the situation poorly and we apologize for this error and the distress caused to the customer. We’ve taken corrective measures with our staff and removed the offensive graffiti,” the coffee shop said in its initial apology.

“We’re committed to ongoing staff training for a safe and welcoming environment. Thank you for understanding that we are a small business doing our best to operate a community business in a difficult environment.”"
58,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Billboard trucks deployed to Harvard demanding president Claudine Gay be fired,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/billboard-trucks-deployed-to-harvard-demanding-president-claudine-gay-be-fired/,"Billboard trucks calling for Harvard President Claudine Gay to be fired were seen circling the Massachusetts campus on Sunday, following the resignation of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill.

The privately-funded trucks read “FIRE GAY” and were accompanied by photos of Gay during her appearance before Congress last week, according to Fox News.

The Havard president, Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth have been under criticism after failing to condemn students’ calls for the genocide of Jews.

One truck was seen driving around the campus, while another was positioned at the school’s main gate blaring Gay’s exchange with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, in which the Harvard president said calls for genocide only qualify as harassment or bullying “depending on the context.”

The unidentified private funder of the billboards will also deploy a plane over campus later this week with a banner reading: “HARVARD — STOP JEW HATRED,” Fox News reports.

“One down, two to go,” the private funder told Fox.

His remarks echoed those of Stefanik, who called on Harvard and MIT to “do the right thing” in the aftermath of Magill’s resignation.

She warned that the two schools can now “anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions’ negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, funding and overall leadership and governance.”

The group StopAntisemitism also wrote, “Let’s hope Harvard’s President Gay is next.”

“The system at Harvard along with the ideology that grips far too many of the students and faculty, the ideology that works only along axes of oppression and places Jews as oppressors and therefore intrinsically evil, is itself evil,” David Wolpe wrote.

He praised Gay as a “kind and thoughtful” person but said her congressional comments were “painfully inadequate” in addressing spiraling antisemitism on the Cambridge campus and elsewhere.

In response to the backlash for her testimony, Gay apologized for her remarks.

“I am sorry. Words matter,” Gay said during an interview with the Harvard Crimson on Thursday.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she added.

But as the trucks circled on Sunday, the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers convened Sunday to discuss Gay’s leadership, the backlash to her response to Congress and whether the school should issue a public statement, according to the Harvard Crimson.

The Post has reached out to Harvard for comment."

Sheriff deputies found Father Stephen Gutgsell with stab wounds around 5 a.m. after he was allegedly attacked by Kierre Williams inside St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said.

Gutgsell was rushed to University of Nebraska Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Williams, 43, of Sioux City, Iowa, was still in the rectory when authorities arrived, and was arrested for homicide and use of a weapon to commit a felony, the sheriff’s office said.

Law enforcement were initially called to the scene for an attempted break-in at the church located in Fort Calhoun, a city of about 1,000 that is 20 miles north of Omaha.

The Archdiocese of Omaha said in a statement Gutgsell was assaulted during an “invasion at the rectory” at the church.

“Please join Archbishop George Lucas in prayer for the repose of Father Gutgsell, for his family and for the St. John the Baptist parish community in this tragic time,” the archdiocese said in a statement, according to Omaha World-Herald.

St. John the Baptist parishioner Mike Fitzgerald told the Omaha-World-Herald the usual 8:30 a.m. Mass was called off. He remembered Gutgsell, who was at the church for 11 years, as a “very holy man.”

“He did a lot of things for the community,” he said. “He always made sure that the (church) bulletin had everything we needed to know about things going on at the church.”

More than a decade ago, Gutgsell pleaded guilty to theft by deception in 2007 for embezzling $127,000 from an area church and was sentenced to probation and restitution.

He was reassigned to another church after church leaders said then he learned his lesson and sought forgiveness.

Washington Sheriff Mike Robinson told WOWT-TV his office did not believe Gutgsell’s death was related to his past criminal trouble.

Authorities said Sunday further information would come from the Washington County District Attorney’s Office.

“This incident was an example of good old fashioned policing where our officers and members of the public worked together to take down a man whose actions were a blight on the community,” Inspector Beth Warren, of Northamptonshire Police, said of the dramatic footage, according to SWNS News.

The scene unfolded on Aug. 23 in Northampton, after police received a call from a member of the public that a man, later identified as Sean Prosser, 28, had carried out a drug deal.

Police constable Lewis Marks jumped into action and pursued Prosser from his police vehicle, the video shows.

Prosser was seen riding a bike and ducked into Beckets Park, forcing the cop to hop out of his car and pursue the suspect on foot.

Marks then spotted a civilian on his own mountain bike and asked to commandeer it.

“Can we borrow your bike? Can we borrow your bike? Thank you,” Marks is heard saying in the footage.

The wild video shows the cop hustling on the mountain bike through the park and city streets until he catches up with Prosser, and tackles the man.

“Ow! My head. I haven’t done anything,” Prosser is heard saying in the footage as the two tussle on the ground.

Marks handcuffed the man and radioed colleagues that he “rammed [Prosser] off his bike.”

“I’m going to get this bike back to its owner. I just grabbed it off a member of the public,” he added.

The video shows the officer cycling back to the park, where he meets up with the owner of the bicycle and thanks him for lending him the mountain bike.

“Mate I caught him, I wouldn’t have caught him without your help,” he tells the man as they shake hands.

Prosser was taken into custody and found to be in the possession of a large sum of cash, and a phone containing text messages related to drug deals, according to SWNS.

Police also found a Kinder egg candy toy that contained heroin and crack cocaine.

He was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, escaping from lawful custody, acquiring/using/possessing criminal property, being concerned in the supply of cocaine and being concerned in the supply of heroin.

He pleaded guilty earlier this month and was sentenced to more than three years behind bars, according to SWNS.

“The quick-thinking of PC Marks ensured Prosser was arrested swiftly and I’d also like to take the opportunity to thank the member of the public who let us borrow his bike,” Inspector Warren of Northamptonshire Police added of the officer’s actions, according to SWNS.

“Tackling drug harm is a matter of priority for Northamptonshire Police and I hope this case demonstrates how quickly we act on community intelligence in order to make our town a nicer place to live.”"

Charlie Glenn said he was asked by his ex-girlfriend, 36-year-old Tonya Nester, to take a walk when he realized that she had a pistol on her, according to a report from WXIX.

“She said it was a pellet gun, and I said, ‘Let me see it because I’m not going anywhere with you if you got a gun,’ and she pulled it out and shot me,” Glenn told the news station.

Police say Glenn was able to wrestle the pistol away from Nester despite being injured and bleeding, while family members called 911.

“She pulled the pistol out and shot me, and I proceeded to take the pistol from her at that point and got her down,” Glenn said. “My family members called 911 because I was shot and bleeding.”

Glenn was rushed back to his house by his friend, Paul Carpenter, after the shooting, according to the report, where Carpenter said he assessed his friend’s injuries.

“My thoughts was, ‘Was he OK, you know, is he dead? Is he alive?’ I didn’t know, but they said he was OK and, you know, it wasn’t life-threatening,” Carpenter said.

Meanwhile, a family member said they saw Nester run from the house and through an alley.

Officers were able to catch up with the ex-girlfriend about a half mile from the house where the shooting occurred, according to the report, resulting in Nester’s arrest.

“It’s unfortunate that somebody would [do that],” Carpenter said. “I don’t know if they had relationship problems or what, but to do something like that is horrible.”

Nester was booked into the Butler County Jail on a $100,000 bond and faces charges of felonious assault.

62,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Progressive Austin DA blasted for psychological toll on cops after dismissing 17 ‘political’ indictments,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/da-blasted-for-psychological-toll-on-cops-after-dismissing-17-political-indictments/,"A progressive district attorney in Austin, Texas dropped indictments against 17 police officers involved in quelling Black Lives Matter riots in 2020 in a move Austin cops past and present tell Fox News Digital was a political smear from the beginning by a top prosecutor determined to demonize police regardless of the effect on the lives of law enforcement.

Travis County District Attorney José Garza announced Monday his office dismissed 17 indictments against police officers after a grand jury indicted 19 of them in February 2022 on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after non-lethal rounds were fired into the crowd.

“Our community is safer when our community trusts enforcement. When it believes law enforcement follows that law and protects the people who live here,” Garza said at the time. “There cannot be trust if there is no accountability when law enforcement breaks the law.”

The indictments were filed despite the officers being exonerated of wrongdoing by the Austin Police Department and critics of Garza, who is backed by liberal mega donor George Soros, pointed to his campaign promises to prosecute police officers and progressive ideology accusing him of launching a “war on cops.”

“This has nothing to do with justice, has nothing do with any wrongdoing,” Austin Police officer Justin Berry, one of the indicted officers who had his charges dropped last week, told Fox News Digital in 2022. “This is simply about politics and a political agenda that has taken place with these radical liberal district attorneys.”

4 Travis County District Attorney José Garza announced Monday his office dismissed 17 indictments against police officers. Travis County DA's Office

Dennis Farris, president of the Austin Police Retired Officers Association, told Fox News Digital it’s “stupid to think that those officers went out there with the idea that they were going to hurt people.”

“That wasn’t the intention. The intention was to protect the police station and protect themselves from the rocks, bottles, frozen water bottles, bottles containing bodily fluids that were thrown at them, some bottles contained bleach — hell they even had a guy that was trying to light a molotov cocktail.”

The city has paid out more than $18 million to resolve civil lawsuits related to protests and eight civil suits remain pending, FOX Austin reported.

Law enforcement members past and present that spoke with Fox News Digital said that Garza’s decision to prosecute these officers caused “irreparable damage” to their lives.

“What Garza did to those officers is a travesty,” a current Austin police officer who wished to remain anonymous told Fox News Digital. “Most will never understand the psychological, physical, financial, and other impacts going through such an unjust nightmare entails. They will never be the same. More broadly, it had a huge negative impact on police morale, played a role in the exodus of officers from APD, and consequently made our city much less safe.”

“The sooner Garza goes, the better. It’s time to get back to real public safety in Austin.”

Berry released a statement after the charges were dropped against him saying that Garza prosecuted him “not on facts” but “on unfiltered emotion to support his personal agenda.”

“His pursuit for political power led to mine and 20 other officers civil rights being violated, our freedom and constitutional rights infringed upon, and reputations tarnished.”

“Jose Garza has known for a long time now that none of us violated any law, yet carried on with his personal punishment,” Berry continued. “As it was told to me in the early days of this, ‘the process will be the punishment.’”

In total, over 20 Austin police officers were indicted by Garza’s office and four officers remain charged by Garza’s office.

Austin-area attorney Doug O’Connell, who represented 9 of the officers who had charges dropped, told Fox News Digital that prosecuting police officers is Garza’s “highest priority” and that the evidence never supported the charges.

“We recognized early on that the evidence didn’t support an indictment or a conviction on the substance,” O’Connell said.

“The dismissal of 17 out of 21 underscores and backs up what we’ve been seeing from the beginning, which was these were political indictments,” O’Connell’s colleague, attorney Ken Ervin, told Fox News Digital. “We don’t think they had really any interest in seeing them through.”

In total, over 20 Austin police officers were indicted by Garza’s office and four officers remain charged, including clients of O’Connell and Ervin.

Despite dropping the charges, Garza’s office asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into the officers actions and the “pattern-or-practice” of the Austin Police Department.

“No parent should fear that if their child chooses to voice their First Amendment right to assemble peacefully, they will walk away with serious bodily injury caused by the very person called upon to protect them,” Garza said.

“We expect the Department of Justice will take our request seriously, and we look forward to working with Mayor Watson, interim APD Chief Robin Henderson, and City Council to ensure full cooperation with the DOJ investigation. We will also continue to hold law enforcement who break the law accountable.”

Ervin told Fox News Digital the letter to the DOJ was simply an attempt by Garza to “save face.”

“They needed some sort of reason why they’re getting rid of most of the cases and that’s it so they said, well, we think it’s a systemic problem, It’s in the Austin police department and so we’re going to address the Austin Police Department as a whole,” Ervin said. ” But that could have been done four years ago or three years ago, two years ago, one year ago. That’s why it’s a bogus reason.”

“I think that the political play was, dismiss 17 now and then down the road, come up with another reason why they’re dismissing more than that. They’re going to be very difficult to prove and get convictions on [them] because of what the officers were doing. You know, using less than lethal munitions on rioters, more than half the department was doing that for three days.”

Farris concurred and told Fox News Digital that Garza “has to be very much embarrassed.”

“Anytime they want to say hey we’re doing something, they turn it over to the feds,” Farris said.

“Even though it’s a good day and these 17 officers have been cleared, it doesn’t make them whole,” Farris said. “It’s been almost two years of them living under this black cloud of indictment. The thought that they were going to be convicted and possibly sent to jail for life for doing their job. It doesn’t make these officers whole. They will never be whole. They were basically used as political pawns by the DA.“

Regarding the investigation and charging decisions against the police officers, Garza’s office told Fox News Digital in a statement that “The process for these cases unfolded as it does in every criminal case in Travis County.”

“It was evident throughout the two-year investigation into the Austin Police Department that there is a pressing need for systemic reform to prevent this from happening again in our community. The most effective way to achieve systemic change within the Austin Police Department is through an investigation conducted by the Department of Justice,” the DA’s office said."
63,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Jewish students at UPenn say Magill’s resignation isn’t enough: ‘A lot still needs to change’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/jewish-students-at-upenn-say-magills-resignation-isnt-enough/,"Jewish students at the University of Pennsylvania said the resignation of President Liz Magill and Chairman Scott Bok was not enough to make them feel safe following a series of antisemitic incidents, arguing that further “change” at the school was necessary.

“There’s a realization that one step is over,” junior Akiva Berkowitz told USA Today outside of Steinhardt Hall, home to the school’s Hillel club. “But the process is not and I don’t want people to think this is the end.”

The student was reacting to Magill and Bok’s resignation on Saturday, adding: “Many things still need to happen. A lot still needs to change.”

Sophomore Jack Cohen said despite Magill and Bok’s resignation, “It’s not comfortable here” and demanded that more be done.

“At the end of the day, we want to see more change,” he said. “We want to feel more supported.

“‘Change’ is the key word — change for the better.”

Jewish students at the Ivy League institution have previously called out school officials for doing nothing while they experienced several antisemitic incidents.

In September, one month before Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel, pro-Palestinian student groups hosted a weekend literature festival on the campus billed as an event to “explore the richness and diversity of Palestinian culture.”

But the event — which featured more than 100 speakers — also hosted some who have been accused of pushing antisemitic agendas, including one person who called for “death to Israel.”

Following the terrorist attack in Israel, pro-Palestinian demonstrations have taken over the campus, featuring chants for “intifada” or uprising, which has also been sprayed as graffiti across the campus alongside “Avenge Gaza.”

A property next to a Jewish fraternity house was also vandalized with the words “Jews R Nazis” at the end of October.

“The protests have not been fun,” Berkowitz said as he left Penn Hillel.

The Maryland native said he wears a yarmulke on campus and has never felt personally threatened, but was taken aback by some of the language he heard during the pro-Palestine rallies.

Megan Singleton, a graduate student at the school, also claimed that after a swastika was found at the Hillel “nothing was really done.”

She said students felt their concerns and suggestions were being ignored by administrators, whose responses were “weak.”

“No one wants to go to an institution not feeling safe to practice their beliefs,” she told USA Today, adding that she was glad to see Magill resign.

The university president had come under pressure from donors and even from members of the school’s administration to resign after testifying that calls for genocide against Jews would only violate the university’s code of conduct depending on the “context.”

Immediately following her Congressional appearance, a federal lawsuit was filed accusing the campus of being a hotbed of antisemitism well ahead of Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault.

The suit — brought by undergraduates Eyal Yakoby and Jordan Davis — claimed Penn broke federal civil rights law when it decided to selectively enforce its rules to “avoid protecting Jewish students from hatred and harassment,” according to Bloomberg Law.

The school has also ignored students’ pleas for protection and hired “rabidly antisemitic professors,” Bloomberg said.

“Emboldened by years of Penn’s tolerance and enabling of antisemitism, and deliberate indifference to Jewish students’ complaints, Penn students and faculty openly support and extol Hamas’s atrocities,” the complaint read.

The lawyer representing the two students in their suit said Sunday that Magill’s resignation is only the first action in making the school a safer place for students.

“This resignation is the first of many necessary steps toward rebuilding a Penn free of antisemitic abuse and harassment,” Marc Kasowitz told USA Today.

“The lawsuit we have brought on behalf of courageous Penn students will ensure that that goal is achieved.”

Meanwhile, at a rally in support of Israel and the Jewish people at the historic Rodeph Shalom synagogue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro spoke about Magill’s resignation.

He said that since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, he has seen Pennsylvanians “take actions big and small” to support Israel and its Jewish community, including the one at the university “where students raised their voices, where students made sure they were heard by their university and they made sure their leadership was held accountable.

“The students did that,” the Jewish governor said.

Magill will continue as interim president and will remain on the law school faculty, university officials have said.

Yousef al-Mansi, an ex-communications minister for the Palestinian terror organization, surrendered to Israel — and proceeded to slam Sinwar as the boss of a group of crazies who threw the Jewish state and Gaza into horrific conflict again by orchestrating the Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed more than 1,200 people, the Times of Israel reported.

“A madman threw a big stone,” al-Mansi said, summing it up for Israel’s Shin Bet interrogators in a video published Sunday.

“This is a group of madmen that Sinwar leads. They destroyed the Gaza Strip. Set it back 200 years,” he said.

Al-Mansi described Sinwar as a man who suffers “delusions of grandeur” and claimed that no civilians in Gaza support Hamas or its leadership after more than two months of war have devastated the Palestinian enclave.

Gaza’s Hamas-tied Health Ministry estimates that more than 17,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, mostly women and children, with the United Nations and independent research groups estimating that a majority of northern Gaza’s infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, too.

“People in the Gaza Strip say that Sinwar and his group destroyed us,” al-Mansi said. “I have not seen anyone in the Gaza Strip who supports Sinwar, nobody likes Sinwar. There are people who, day and night, pray that God will free us from him.”

As with other members of Hamas whose interrogations were filmed and released to the public, al-Mansi added that the group knew the Oct. 7 attack stood against the values of Islam, which forbids the killing of women, children and seniors.

“What they did is unacceptable according to logic, religion or intellect,” al-Mansi said.

The condemnation by the former Hamas official came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touted the latest wave of Hamas surrenders in Gaza, calling on more members of the terror group to give up and no longer fight for Sinwar.

“They are laying down their weapons and turning themselves in to our heroic soldiers,” Netanyahu said of the surrenders in recent days.

“I say to the Hamas terrorists: It’s over. Don’t die for Sinwar. Surrender now,” he added.

Last week, the IDF encircled Sinwar’s home but believe he escaped and is hiding somewhere in Hamas’ underground tunnel system."
65,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,House education committee chair threatens to strip funding from colleges over antisemitism,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/education-committee-chair-threatens-funding-for-colleges-over-antisemitism/,"Congress may cut federal funds flowing to colleges and universities that fail to combat antisemitism on campus, the chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce warned Sunday.

“We cannot tolerate taxpayer dollars going to institutions that allow for antisemitism and for calling for genocide of the Jews,” Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who chairs the panel that launched an investigation into the higher education institutions last week, told Fox News.

The congresswoman stressed that lawmakers aren’t prejudging the situation, telling the outlet the panel “will take the investigation where it leads us.”

Foxx announced a probe into antisemitism on college campuses broadly Thursday, in the wake of the committee’s tense hearing featuring testimony from the presidents of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania.

The three presidents were evasive when asked about condemning student chants including calls “intifada,” which House GOP Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) noted is akin to pushing for “the genocide of Jews.”

Facing blowback over her response, UPenn President Liz Magill resigned Saturday.

Rep. Virginia Foxx condemned the widespread moral rot on college campuses. AP

“This is not just confined to these campuses. We want to look at Columbia, Cornell, and many, many other institutions,” Foxx stressed.

“It should be so easy. This country was founded on religious freedom,” she added. “It should not be difficult to condemn antisemitism and the calling for genocide of the Jews or any other people.”

Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs or activities receiving government money.

Instances of reported antisemitic activity on campuses skyrocketed following that bloody Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel from Hamas.

Fallout from the congressional testimony resulted in UPenn President Liz Magill’s (right) resignation, while calls continue for the departure of Harvard President Claudine Gay. AP

Students, often espousing pro-Palestinian sentiments, have been caught trafficking in Hamas’ rhetoric against the Jews, including repeating phrases like “intifada” and “from the river to the sea.”

Prior to the congressional hearing last Tuesday, Republicans spotlighted the accounts of four Jewish students who emotionally recounted their harrowing experiences on campus.

“People are paying attention because we do have a moral rot,” Foxx said, adding that her panel has been looking to tackle post-secondary education reform broadly for a “long time.”

“I don’t call them elite institutions, I call them the most expensive institutions in the country,” she said. “They are not teaching morality they are not teaching higher order thinking.”

Still, “we don’t want to prejudge what we’re going to find in those investigations,” she added."

Buzz is a Poland-based partner of Irish discount air carrier Ryanair, which operated the evacuated flight that was preparing to depart for Krakow when the emergency began.

A video montage of the incident posted on X shows the chaotic scene unfolding as passengers hastily exit the aircraft via inflatable emergency slides deployed at the plane’s doors.

A number of emergency vehicles surrounded the plane on the snowy tarmac as first responders and airport employees helped passengers evacuate, but no injuries were reported in the incident.

In another segment of the video, the cabin appears smoky as its 189 panicked passengers grab for their belongings and queue up to flee the aircraft.

As the cabin slowly filled with smoke, passengers reportedly had to loudly urge members of the flight crew to open the cabin doors and allow them to exit.

According to AirLive, one passenger described the incident as “highly traumatic.”

In a statement, a Ryanair spokesperson said Buzz engineers were inspecting the aircraft and that a replacement plane had been routed to Arlanda to get passengers to their original destination.

“A Buzz aircraft this morning (10 Dec) in Arlanda reported fumes in the cabin. As a precaution, passengers were evacuated and returned to the terminal,” the statement read in part.

“We apologise sincerely to affected passengers for this delay which we are doing everything to minimise,” the spokesperson said.

“Refreshment vouchers have been issued to passengers in Arlanda.”

According to reports, passengers had to raise their voices at cabin crew before they opened cabin doors to let them out. aviationbrk/X

Ryanair has courted controversy in the past and has been an occasional fixture in news headlines for unusual incidents onboard its planes.

In July, passengers on a Ryanair flight to Italy were left stranded on the tarmac with no air conditioning in over 100-degree heat when their flight was delayed more than 10 hours, leading some to pass out.

Then in September Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary was pelted with pies by environmental protesters in Brussels."

YouTuber Hunter Avallone, known for debating with conservatives online, was at his Martinsburg apartment with gal pal Holle Peno, a Twitch streamer, when her ex of 11 years showed up and shot through the door, striking Peno in the leg, the streamer wrote on Instagram.

Avallone, who boasts more than half a million subscribers, began filming moments after Peno was shot, noting in the footage that his landlord had warned him about a “shady” man on the property with a gun under his jacket.

Peno’s former boyfriend, referred to as Conrad in the video, died by suicide after shooting through Avallone’s apartment door, according to the post. The pair had broken up several weeks before, according to Peno’s social media accounts.

“I recorded the final moments in which we’re hiding on the back porch,” Avallone wrote next to footage showing Peno looking distraught and bleeding.

“You can hear him shoot at police before ultimately taking his own life…in my own f—king apartment hallway,” Avallone wrote.

Avallone appears to be on the phone with police at one point in the video, telling them the suspect is pounding hard on the door and that they can hear shouting.

Voices can then be heard in the video screaming, “Show me your f–king hands! Show me your hands!” before multiple gunshots ring out and the video abruptly ends.

“Still trying to process this. Holle and I are physically ok but mentally, this is gonna do some serious damage,” Avallone wrote. “Holle has been amazing and she’s been incredibly brave and strong throughout this ordeal.”

Peno, who has nearly 17,000 followers, posted an emotional video to X on Sunday saying, “It feels like my soul was ripped in half.

“Every time I close my eyes, I see him lying there,” Peno says through sobs. “I hate how that was the last time I saw him because he wasn’t all bad. He was good sometimes.”

In an Instagram post Sunday, Peno said she was starting to “come out of shock.

“I feel so torn up inside. I loved him for 11 years despite the abuse, and he couldn’t love me enough to let me leave,” she wrote.

A GoFundMe set up by a fellow Twitch streamer to cover Peno’s hospital bills noted that her ex tried to shoot at police before taking his own life. More than $4,000 had been raised by Sunday afternoon.

“The money will get used towards paying the hospital bills, and paying her own personal expenses from being unable to work, including the costs of therapy, travel, food, existing debt and everything she could need in the near future,” the fundraiser read.

“Now that he passed, she’s still gonna have to pay the accumulated debt that they both shared. This fund is an umbrella meant to cover as much as it can until she can get her life back on track again,” it said.

The Martinsburg Police Department had no comment when contacted by The Post on Sunday.

But in a statement to the Daily Mail, the department confirmed the incident, writing, “On Friday, December 8, an unidentified male arrived at the location armed with a shotgun. The individual discharged the firearm through the exterior door of the building, striking a female victim.

“Responding immediately to the scene, Martinsburg Police officers engaged with the armed suspect as he attempted to breach an interior apartment door while continuing to fire his weapon,” the statement read.

“A brief exchange of gunfire ensued, resulting in the suspect taking his own life.”

Zelensky is invited to the White House for a meeting Tuesday to “underscore the United States’ unshakeable commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal invasion,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.

“As Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, the leaders will discuss Ukraine’s urgent needs and the vital importance of the United States’ continued support at this critical moment,” Jean-Pierre added.

Zelensky last visited Washington, DC, in September following a trip to the UN General Assembly Summit of World Leaders in New York.

At the time, Biden was pressing Congress for $24 billion in additional assistance to the war-torn nation.

Congress has yet to greenlight more aid. Now that ask is hovering around $61 billion, according to a sprawling $106 billion supplemental the White House unveiled in October featuring support for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the border.

Talks over further aid to Ukraine have been crippled by stark divisions between Republicans and Democrats over how to proceed on the border provisions.

Republicans have been adamant that more aid to Ukraine be paired with bolstered border security.

Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) are leading the discussions on the Senate side.

This is the Senate’s final scheduled week of legislating this year, elevating the stakes to hash out a deal.

Biden’s White House is expected to step up involvement in the deliberations.

Since the war broke out in Ukraine, Congress has approved $113 billion in both humanitarian and military support, though not all of that has been spent.

“We are out of money, and nearly out of time,” White House budget chief Shalanda Young pressed congressional leaders last Monday in a letter.

“This isn’t a next year problem. The time to help a democratic Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now.”

Zelensky had been expected to brief lawmakers last week, but that got abruptly scrapped due to a last-minute interruption in his schedule according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

70,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Democrat says charges against ‘very troubled’ Hunter Biden are ‘legally justified’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/democrat-says-charges-against-very-troubled-hunter-biden-legally-justified/,"Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy defended the latest charges slapped against Hunter Biden on Sunday, calling them “legally justified” while slamming the first son as “very troubled.”

Murphy (D-Ct.) ripped into the scandal-plagued first son’s behavior, while simultaneously pushing back on Republicans for using it as a cudgel against President Biden.

“I think this is a very troubled individual who has done things that are worthy of prosecution,” Murphy told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.

“The American people understand that Hunter Biden is not going to be on the ballot next fall — that Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot.”

Hunter Biden was slapped with nine fresh charges last week — three felonies and six misdemeanors — for alleged tax violations.

The first son previously pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges for alleged willful failure to pay his income taxes and three charges for alleged illegal possession of a firearm while addicted to illicit drugs.

4 Chris Murphy condemned Hunter Biden’s conduct, but praised his father.

Last week’s charges resembled some of the allegations made by IRS whistleblowers who cried foul that more charges hadn’t been lodged against the first son.

The whistleblowers claimed that Delaware US Attorney David Weiss sought tax charges against the first son from prosecutors in California and Washington, DC, but was turned down.

They broadly claimed that the Justice Department showed favoritism to Hunter Biden. Weiss was elevated to special counsel back in August.

Despite bashing Hunter’s behavior, Murphy commended President Biden as a “president who has led an economic recovery that has been unprecedented.”

Murphy also said that he believes it’s inappropriate for a family member of a politician to profit off their last name.

“Frankly when I look at the Trump family, it seems that they have made an industry out of profiting off Donald Trump’s presidency,” he said.

The senator noted how former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s firm scored a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia after his White House exit.

“Hunter Biden is going to be held accountable in court for any violations of the law he’s committed,” Murphy added when pressed about the first son’s business machinations.

House Republicans have opened an impeachment inquiry into the president, revolving around alleged influence peddling from his family members, most prominently Hunter Biden.

That inquiry hasn’t been formally authorized, but Republicans have signaled they intend to hold a formal vote to make it official.

Last month, Republicans subpoenaed Hunter Biden to appear for testimony this coming Wednesday.

His lawyers offered him up to testify publicly, but the GOP slapped that down.

The White House has panned the investigations into the president as a partisan endeavor.

“They want to overturn what happened in 2020 and they’re using their power to launch these baseless political attacks against the president,” White House spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC Sunday."
71,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Trump says he actually won’t testify in his own defense at NY civil fraud trial: ‘Nothing more to say’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/trump-wont-testify-in-his-own-defense-at-ny-civil-fraud-trial/,"Donald Trump, in an about-face on Sunday, announced he won’t be testifying in his own defense at the New York civil fraud trial that threatens his real estate empire.

“I have already testified to everything & have nothing more to say other than this is a complete & total election interference (Biden campaign!) witch hunt that will do nothing but keep businesses out of New York,” the former president — who was expected to be called to the stand by his attorneys on Monday — said in an all-caps post on his social media platform Truth Social.

“I will not be testifying on Monday,” he added in the two-part post.

Trump, 77, was set to testify again as one of the final witnesses in his defense case against New York Attorney General Letitia James’ claims that he exaggerated his worth by billions a year for better loan and insurance terms.

During heated testimony last month, after he was called to the stand by lawyers with the AG’s office, Trump and his team clashed multiple times with Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, who is deciding the non-jury case.

He also unexpectedly and briefly took the witness stand in October when Engoron wanted to question Trump about possible violations of the limited gag order barring him and his lawyers from talking about the judge’s court staff.

During that short stint on the stand, Trump denied that he was referring to Engoron’s chief law clerk Allison Greenfield when he said: “This judge is a very partisan judge with a person who is very partisan sitting alongside him.”

But the jurist said he didn’t buy Trump’s claims that he was actually referring to Michael Cohen — his former lawyer and “fixer” who was testifying at the time — and he fined the 45th president $10,000 on top of a previous $5,000 fine for violating his gag order.

Trump has attended eight days out of the 42 days of trial so far, though he is not required to be present in court like he would be in a criminal case.

His son Eric Trump had similarly been expected to take the stand again in the defense case after being called as a witness by the AG’s team, but also ended up not testifying as planned.

An expert witness called by Trump’s lawyers late last week — Eli Bartov, a professor of accounting at New York University — is expected to wrap testimony on Tuesday.

Trump most recently attended trial Thursday to observe the testimony of Bartov, who told the court “there is no evidence whatsoever for any accounting fraud” and claimed James’ case has “no merit.”

Trump lauded the testimony as a win for his case, saying that “one of the greatest experts” and a “highly respected man” said he shouldn’t be found liable for fraud.

The 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner has taken nearly every opportunity in front of the media at court to attack Engoron, James and the trial claiming he’s a victim of a political witch hunt.

In a bombshell ruling from just before the start of the trial, Engoron found the former commander-in-chief liable on one of the main fraud claims by the AG’s office.

In that decision, he revoked the Trump Organization’s business licenses in the Empire state, but that has been put on hold until the trial concludes.

The AG will put on a brief rebuttal case following the conclusion of Bartov’s testimony.

Engoron is not expected to render his verdict in the case — which threatens the Trump real estate empire in the state — until late January."
72,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Freed hostage Mia Schem gets tattoo defiant of Hamas after Oct. 7 music festival horrors: ‘We will dance again’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/freed-hostage-mia-schem-gets-defiant-tattoo/,"A 21-year-old woman recently released by Hamas after being kidnapped from a music festival in Israel on Oct. 7 has gotten a defiant tattoo that reads, “We will dance again.”

Mia Schem — an Israeli-French tattoo artist who was abducted by Hamas from the Tribe of Nova desert rave and later released as part of a temporary cease-fire between the terror organization and Israel — shared photos of her new ink in a moving Instagram post Saturday night.

The tattoo on Schem’s left forearm reads, “We will dance again” above “7.10.23” to mark the horrific attack, when hundreds of Israelis were killed and she and dozens of others abducted, sparking the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I will never forget October 7, 2023,” Schem wrote in the post.

“The pain and the fear, the difficult sights, the friends who won’t come back, and those we must bring back. But we will win, we will dance!”

5 Mia Schem, 21, shared images of a defiant new tattoo she got after being freed. Polaris

5 Schem’s tattoo reads, “We will dance again” and has the date of her kidnapping by Hamas. Polaris

Schem was among the dozens of partygoers abducted by Hamas from the rave, where Hamas slaughtered nearly 400 other festival-goers.

Soon after the start of the war, she was seen in a chilling video released by Hamas showing her receiving treatment from a veterinarian for a wound on her right arm.

“At the moment, I am in Gaza,” Schem tells the camera in Hebrew in the 60-second clip.

She said she was injured and taken across the border, where she underwent a three-hour surgery to treat her undisclosed injuries.

“They are taking care of me, giving me medicine, everything is fine. I only ask that they bring me home as soon as possible to my parents, to my siblings,” she said in the video. “Get me out of here as soon as possible. Please.”

Schem’s family held a series of press conferences after the video’s release, begging for her safe return.

5 Hamas released a video of Schem receiving treatment for her injuries.

The young tattoo artist was released by Hamas on Nov. 30 and has since been reunited with her family, who says she is “traumatized” by what was done to her by the terror organization.

“She’s thin, she’s weak,” her aunt, Vivian Hadar, said of Schem, noting, “A veterinarian operated on her arm. She did physical therapy for herself.

“She knew she needed to give herself hand massages,” Hadar explained of her kin, adding that Schem’s hand is still “very sore.”

5 Schem also shared that she was thankful to be celebrating Hanukkah at home with her family after her release. Instagram/Mia Schem

Her aunt said she is not asking Schem much about what she endured in her nearly 50 days in captivity “because when we started asking, we saw that it was difficult for her.

“We are glad that she is with us,” Hadar said, but “it is difficult to see her in this situation.

“It’s not an easy time,” the aunt said. “It’s not easy what she went through, and we’re looking forward.”

The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that allowed for Schem’s release ended earlier this month, as the Jewish nation blamed the terror group for violating the truce by launching rockets toward Israeli territory before the agreement expired.

Moments after the cease-fire ended, the Israeli military resumed its attack in Gaza, launching airstrikes on the Palestinian territory for the first time since the pause in fighting began Nov. 24."
73,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Big divisions loom over fossil fuels’ future as COP28 climate summit talks head into final phase,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/big-divisions-loom-over-fossil-fuels-as-cop28-talks-head-into-final-phase/,"DUBAI, Dec 10 – The president of the COP28 climate summit on Sunday urged negotiators to work harder to find consensus on a proposed first-of-its-kind deal to phase out the world’s use of fossil fuels, as the two-week conference entered its final stage.

The talks in Dubai have highlighted deep international divisions over the future role of oil, gas and coal that are complicating efforts by nearly 200 countries to hash out an agreement before the summit’s scheduled end on Dec. 12.

A coalition of more than 80 countries including the United States, the European Union and small island nations are pushing for an agreement at COP28 that includes language to “phase out” fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming.

They are coming up against tough opposition led by the oil producer group OPEC and its allies.

Seeking a breakthrough on Sunday, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber took the unusual step of convening a ‘majlis’ — an Arabic term for a communal gathering — where delegations could speak in a different forum to the formal forward-facing plenary hall.

“We are now in the end game,” Jaber said. “I hope that you won’t let me down.”

Speaking in a circular configuration, delegations restated their positions, but it was not immediately obvious that the forum had yielded a shift in positions.

OPEC had issued a letter to its members and backers on Dec. 6 asking them to oppose any language targeting fossil fuels in a COP28 deal, and observers in the negotiations told Reuters that some of those delegations appeared to be heeding the call.

“I think there are still quite entrenched positions,” Adam Guibourgé-Czetwertyński, Poland’s deputy minister for climate who is heading the country’s COP28 delegation, said prior to the majlis on Sunday.

OPEC’s biggest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, along with Russia and others, have argued that the focus of COP28 should be on reducing emissions, not on targeting the fuel sources that cause them.

China’s top climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, on Saturday said a COP28 deal can only be considered a success if it includes an agreement on fossil fuels – though he did not say whether Beijing would back a “phase-out” deal.

“The positions on the issue are currently very antagonistic, and China is trying to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties and can solve the problems,” he said, describing COP28 as the hardest climate summit of his career.

U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry met with Xie at the China delegation offices for 45 minutes on Sunday. Kerry did not say what the pair discussed.

A draft text published on Sunday proposed that next year’s COP29 climate summit be hosted by Azerbaijan between Nov. 11 and Nov. 22. The text will need to be adopted by the summit before it becomes official.

SLEW OF COMMITMENTS

The latest version of the core negotiating text, released on Friday, shows that countries were still considering a range of options — from agreeing to a “phase out of fossil fuels in line with best available science,” to phasing out “unabated fossil fuels”, to including no mention at all.

Abating fossil fuels typically means reducing their climate impact by either capturing and storing their carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon capture is expensive and has yet to be proven at scale.

Three sources told Reuters that the COP28 presidency did not intend to release another draft until Monday, something that would leave negotiators just one full day to resolve differences ahead of the conference’s scheduled end on Tuesday before noon.

Speaking at the majlis on Sunday, a representative for Saudi Arabia’s delegation reiterated its position that a COP28 deal should not pick and choose energy sources, but should instead focus on cutting emissions.

“We have been thinking hard about how to send an inclusive signal to the world on what the science is telling us, entirely without cherry picking,” the representative said. “We have raised our consistent concerns over the attempts to attack energy sources instead of emissions.”

OPEC member Iraq echoed the stance.

Britain and Australia were among the few countries to offer a glimmer of compromise, saying flexibility on the fossil fuel language was possible as long as there were enough safeguards.

The European Union, meanwhile, reiterated its position that the phase-out of fossil fuels was an essential component of any deal to avert the worst of climate change.

“We are running out of time. And with all respect for your deadline, the time we are running out of is the time for our planet,” said Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s chief negotiator at COP28.

The conference has yielded a slew of other commitments from countries to hit targets like tripling renewable energy and nuclear power deployments, slash coal use and curb emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Sunday said these pledges – if honoured – would lower global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by 4 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.

While the figure is substantial, it represents only about a third of the emissions gap that needs to be closed in the next six years to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the IEA said.

“An ‘orderly & just decline of global fossil fuel use’ is needed to keep 1.5C in reach,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the Doha Forum, urged leaders at COP28 to agree on deep cuts to emissions to stop global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Guterres said that despite pledges, emissions are at a record high and fossil fuels are the major cause.

“I urge leaders at COP28 in Dubai to agree on deep cuts to emissions, in line with the 1.5-degree limit,” he said.

74,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Negotiations for deal on border and Ukraine stalls, blame-trading ensues: ‘Republican demands unreasonable’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/negotiations-for-deal-on-border-and-ukraine-stalls-blame-trading-ensues/,"Congressional Republicans and Democrats remain at loggerheads over how to tackle border security and a supplemental aid package for Ukraine, with just one week to go till their holiday recess.

Top negotiators Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) laid into each side’s position in dueling Sunday morning-show appearances.

“Right now, Republican demands are unreasonable,” Murphy told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“If I were a cynic, I would say that Republicans have decided to tie support for Ukraine to immigration reform because they want Ukraine aid to fail,” the Democrat said.

Murphy underscored that he is “not a cynic” and that Democrats are “still trying to resolve some pretty big differences that remain.”

Lankford fired back on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “This started with the Biden administration saying that we need to do a national security package that has Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and the border.

“All we’re trying to do is to say what tools are needed to be able to get this back in control so we don’t have the chaos on our southern border,” the GOPer said.

6 Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) blasted Republican demands as “unreasonable.”

Since House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) took the gavel, he has been adamant that Congress pair Ukraine aid and border security together.

With that in mind, the White House rolled out a sprawling $106 billion supplemental request including support for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, border security and more.

But Republicans blasted the border provisions as woefully insufficient.

Both Murphy and Lankford have been negotiating on border provisions for about a month but appear to remain far apart from each other.

Encounters with migrants at the border have skyrocketed under President Biden’s watch.

During fiscal year 2023 a record 3.2 million encounters were reported, including 309,000 in October alone, according to data from US Border Patrol.

Nearly all Republicans, including moderates such as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah.), appear to be on board with linking border security and Ukraine aid.

Even some Democrats including Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) have said discussions about the border are a “reasonable conversation.”

Lankford lauded the Secure the Border Act of 2023, which cleared the GOP-led House of Representatives with no Democratic support earlier this year, as a model.

“Obviously, we’re not going to get 20, 30 Democrats in the Senate, or a Democratic White House to be able to sign that. But that doesn’t mean we just sit and do nothing,” he said.

Meanwhile, a large swath of the migrants pouring across the border are seeking asylum, and Murphy vowed that Democrats will oppose any legislation to block off the border to those “legitimately” pursuing asylum.

6 Republicans are grappling with a base that is uneasy about writing another big check to war-torn Ukraine. AP

Still, he was open to “tightening some of the rules, so that you don’t have 10,000 people arriving a day.”

Democrats are seemingly wary about ceding too much ground to Republicans out of concern that they will have less leverage in future negotiations for a permanent solution to the so-called “Dreamers” — or undocumented migrants who grew up in the US — and illegal immigrants.

Last week, Politico reported that Republicans were pitching an expulsion authority similar to the pandemic-era Title 42, which permitted border agents to immediately turn away migrants at the border — even asylum-seekers.

“No, it’s actually not accurate,” Lankford said of that report. “There are several things that I have proposed on that, some things that I haven’t.”

6 House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is backing the negotiations, according to Sen. James Lankford. AP

He did not go into much detail about what was correct and what wasn’t.

This week, the White House will likely step up involvement in the negotiations over the issues, Murphy said.

The Senate is scheduled to adjourn for a holiday break at the end of this week, raising the stakes for negotiations.

White House and military officials have warned that funding for Ukraine is running low, too.

Last week, Biden chided that GOP recalcitrance on funding would be a Christmas “gift” to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Lankford retorted, “I’m by far no fan of Vladimir Putin, and the president knows that full well.

“This is not a Christmas present to him. If we’re going to deal with national security, we’ve got to deal with Ukraine, and we have to deal with the border.”"

76,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Hamas threatens to kill all remaining hostages if demands are not met,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/hamas-threatens-to-kill-all-remaining-hostages-if-demands-are-not-met/,"Hamas on Sunday threatened to kill all of its remaining hostages if demands such as more aid for Gaza and prisoner exchanges were not met, after suffering repeated losses in its battle with Israel.

The Palestinian terror group is still holding the bodies of 20 hostages who died in captivity, Israel said over the weekend.

Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, claimed Sunday that not another single kidnap victim will leave Gaza alive unless Israel agrees to all its demands in negotiations that broke down at the start of December.

At least some of those demands have been for more aid for Gaza residents and the freeing of Palestinian prisoners.

“Neither the fascist enemy and its arrogant leadership … nor its supporters … can take their prisoners alive without an exchange and negotiation and meeting the demands of the resistance,” Obeida said in a televised broadcast.

The ultimatum came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that of the 137 hostages believed to still be in Hamas custody, 20 are dead.

More than 100 were freed in an aid and prisoner pact last month.

Hamas had previously accused Israel of killing hostages during its relentless airstrike campaigns in northern Gaza, with the allegations reiterated in a Hamas video by hostage Yarden Bibas, who blamed Netanyahu for the death of his wife and two young boys.

Israel slammed the claims as propaganda, and it has accused the terror group of stooping so low as to even refuse to hand over the bodies of its dead.

Hamas is allegedly trying to leverage the corpses in the stalled hostage exchange negotiations in hopes of freeing more Palestinians from Israeli prisons and seeing more aid trucks arrive in Gaza.

The terrorists had freed more than 100 hostages during a seven-day cease-fire last month, but after the two sides failed to agree on an eighth wave of exchanges, the war resumed Dec. 1.

Since the end of the cease-fire, 3,500 Hamas targets have been taken out in the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces said Sunday, with more than 22,000 targets destroyed since the war began Oct. 7 with Hamas’ deadly sneak attack on Israel.

A senior IDF official claimed that with Israel’s latest advancements in northern and southern Gaza, there are now “signs of Hamas breaking,” the Times of Israel reports.

“The extent of the destruction and damage creates command and control problems [for Hamas]. There are areas in the Gaza Strip that Hamas no longer controls militarily,” the official said.

But despite Israel’s latest victories across Gaza, the official said fighting will only intensify as Hamas continues to hold out for as long as it can.

After nearly two months of warfare in northern Gaza, including raiding and destroying multiple headquarters, the IDF is focusing its bombardments around Khan Younis, the largest city in the south.

There has been heavy fighting reported in the center of the city, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled after being evacuated from the north.

During the fighting, the IDF encircled the northern Gaza home of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to have orchestrated the Oct. 7 massacre that killed more than 1,200 Israelis.

But Sinwar had already allegedly escaped south by hiding out in an evacuating humanitarian vehicle and is believed to be in one of the tunnels in Khan Younis that is part of Hamas’ extensive underground network, the Times of Israel reported.

Along with taking out half of Hamas’ estimated 24 battalion leaders, the Israeli military estimates that about 7,000 Hamas terrorists have been killed during the war.

Gaza’s Hamas-linked Health Ministry believes the war has claimed more than 17,700 victims in all, the majority women and children, with an IDF spokesman previously describing the ratio of terrorists to civilians killed as “positive.”

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged the Jewish state to do more to avoid the deaths of civilians in the Palestinian enclave, acknowledging that not enough has been done by America’s staunch ally.

“The intent is there, but the results are not always manifesting themselves,” Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.

Blinken said Israel needs to conduct lengthier pauses in the war to allow civilians to escape and for more aid to arrive for the nearly 2 million Palestinians who have been displaced since the conflict began.

Despite the concerns over Israel’s handling of the war, Blinken noted that the Jewish state has the final say on how it will conduct the fighting and when it will end.

“We have these discussions with Israel, including about the duration as well as how it is prosecuting this campaign against Hamas,” he said. “These are decisions for Israel to make.

“But Hamas has decisions to make, too. It could get out from hiding behind civilians tomorrow. It could put down its arms tomorrow. It could surrender tomorrow, and this would be over,” the US’s top diplomat said.

Blinken also defended America’s decision to bypass a congressional vote to sell nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition for Israel.

The secretary of state said the sale was only a small amount of what Israel needs as he called on Congress to pass a $100 billion aid bill for Israel, Ukraine and other national security necessities.

The impasse is deepening in Congress despite dire warnings from the White House about the consequences of inaction as Republicans insist on pairing the aid with changes to America’s immigration and border policies.

After the Democratic president said this past week he was willing to “make significant compromises on the border,” Republicans quickly revived demands that they had earlier set aside, hardening their positions and attempting to shift the negotiations to the right, according to a person familiar with the talks who was not authorized to publicly discuss them and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The latest proposal, from the lead GOP negotiator, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., came during a meeting with a core group of senators before they left Washington on Thursday afternoon. It could force the White House to consider ideas that many Democrats will seriously oppose, throwing new obstacles in the difficult negotiations.

Biden is facing the prospect of a cornerstone of his foreign policy — repelling Russian President Vladimir Putin from overtaking Ukraine — crumbling as U.S. support for funding the war wanes, especially among Republicans. The White House says a failure to approve more aid by year’s end could have catastrophic consequences for Ukraine and its ability to fight.

To preserve U.S. backing, the Biden administration has quietly engaged in Senate talks on border policy in recent weeks, providing assistance to the small group of senators trying to reach a deal and communicating what policy changes it would find acceptable.

The president is trying to satisfy GOP demands to reduce the historic number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border while alleviating Democrats’ fears that legal immigration will be choked off with drastic measures.

As talks sputtered to a restart this past week, Democrats warned Republicans that time for a deal was running short. Congress is scheduled to depart Washington in mid-December for a holiday break.

“Republicans need to show they are serious about reaching a compromise, not just throwing on the floor basically Donald Trump’s border policies,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday before Republicans made their counteroffer.

But the new Republican proposal dug in on policy changes that had led Democrats to step back from the negotiations, according to the person familiar with the talks. The GOP offer calls for ending the humanitarian parole program that’s now in place for existing classes of migrants — Ukrainians, Afghans, Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians. That idea had been all but dashed before.

Additionally, those groups of migrants would not be allowed to be paroled again if the terms of their stay expire before their cases are adjudicated in immigration proceedings.

GOP senators proposed monitoring systems such as ankle bracelets for people, including children, who are detained at the border and are awaiting parole. Republicans want to ban people from applying for asylum if they have transited through a different country where they could have sought asylum instead. GOP lawmakers also want to revive executive powers that would allow a president to shut down entries for wide-ranging reasons.

Further, after migrant encounters at the border recently hit historic numbers, the GOP proposal would set new guidelines requiring the border to be essentially shut down if illegal crossings reach a certain limit.

Lankford declined to discuss specifics after the Thursday meeting, but said he was trying to “negotiate in good faith.” He said the historic number of migrants at the border could not be ignored. The sheer number of people arriving at the border has swamped the asylum system, he said, making it impossible for authorities to adequately screen the people they allow in.

“Do you want large numbers of undocumented individuals and unscreened individuals without work permits, without access to the rest of the economy?” Lankford said.

The lead Democratic negotiator, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, did not quickly respond to the GOP proposal.

Senators had made some progress in the talks before Thursday, finding general agreement on raising the initial standard for migrants to enter the asylum system — part of what’s called the credible fear system. The administration has communicated that it is amenable to that change and that it could agree to expand expedited removal to deport immigrants before they have a hearing with an immigration judge, according to two people briefed on the private negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Immigration advocates and progressives in Congress have been alarmed by the direction of the talks, especially because they have not featured changes aimed at expanding legal immigration.

Robyn Barnard, director of refugee advocacy with Human Rights First, called the current state of negotiations an “absolute crisis moment.” She warned that broadening the fast-track deportation authority could lead to a mass rounding up of immigrants around the country and compared it to the situation during the Trump administration. “Communities across the country would be living in fear,” she said.

But Republican senators, sensing that Biden, who is campaigning for a second term, wants to address the historic number of people coming to the border, have taken an aggressive stance and tried to draw the president directly into negotiations.

“The White House is going to have to engage particularly if Senate Democrats are unwilling to do what we are suggesting be done,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., at a news conference Thursday.

The White House has so far declined to take a leading role in negotiations. “Democrats have said that they want to compromise. Have that conversation,” said White House press secretary Karine-Jean Pierre.

After every GOP senator this past week voted not to move ahead with legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance for Ukraine, many in the chamber were left in a dour mood. Even those who held out hope for a deal acknowledged it would be difficult to push a package through the Senate at this late stage.

Even if senators reach a deal, the obstacles to passage in the House are considerable. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has signaled he will fight for sweeping changes to immigration policy that go beyond what is being discussed in the Senate. Also, broad support from House Democrats is far from guaranteed, as progressives and Hispanic lawmakers have raised alarm at curtailing access to asylum.

“Trading Ukrainian lives for the lives of asylum seekers is morally bankrupt and irresponsible,” Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as part of a coordinated campaign by Hispanic Democrats.

The unwieldy nature of the issue left even Lankford, who was one of the few senators optimistic that a deal could be reached this year, acknowledging the difficulty of finding an agreement in the coming days.

“There’s just a whole lot of politics that have been bound up in this,” he said as he departed the Capitol for the week. “Thirty years it hasn’t been resolved because it’s incredibly complicated.”"
78,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Pentagon’s mysterious X-37B unmanned space drone set to launch again,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/pentagons-mysterious-x-37b-set-to-launch-again/,"The US Space Force’s mysterious X-37B unmanned drone is expected to soar into space once again, this time reaching new heights — as some speculate it may be used to search for threats from hostile nations’ satellites.

The oddly-shaped spacecraft with stubby wings and a rounded, bulldog-like nose was originally set to take off from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Sunday night, but its launch was delayed as powerful storms make their way across the East Coast.

With the “vigorous” showers, high winds and cloud coverage, Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron estimated the chances of a successful launch at just 40 percent Sunday night.

By Monday night, however, the chances of success rise to 70 percent, according to Elon Musk’s SpaceX — which won the $130 million contract to launch the spacecraft in 2018.

It is now scheduled to launch the X-37B via Falcon Heavy rocket at 8:14 p.m. Monday from the Kennedy Space Center.

“The team will use the time to complete additional pre-launch check outs,” SpaceX posted on X.

The extra time may prove handy amid speculation that the aircraft’s mission will be in higher orbit than in previous missions, as The Falcon Heavy is more powerful than the rockets that have launched the drones in the past.

“We are excited to expand the envelope of the reusable X-37B’s capabilities, using the flight-proven service module and Falcon Heavy rocket to fly multiple cutting-edge experiments for the Department of the Air Force and its partners,” Lt. Col. Joseph Fritschen, the X-37B program director said in a statement.

Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman went on to explain that the upcoming flight, dubbed OTV-7, will carry “groundbreaking” experiments that will “equip the United States with the knowledge to enhance current and future space operations.”

Among the tests the unmanned drone is expected to conduct in space are experiments “with future space domain awareness technologies,” according to the military.

Experts speculate that could imply that the X-37B will be keeping an eye on satellites launched by enemy nations, scanning beyond the skies for potential threats.

“Our space systems are threatened by a variety of growing anti-satellite capabilities, and the joint force is threatened by increasingly sophisticated adversary space-based systems intended to target the joint force,” Saltzman said in a statement to Congress earlier this year.

The flight is also expected to “expose plant seeds to the harsh radiation environment of long-duration space flight” in an experiment for NASA, the Space Force says.

The Pentagon has previously used X-37Bs to test some of its new technologies, including a small solar panel designed to transform solar energy into microwaves, which could one day allow energy harnessed from space to be beamed back to Earth, the Washington Post reports.

X-37Bs have also been used to deploy small satellites — though it remains unclear what these satellites actually did.

It’s also still unknown why the vehicle — capable of surviving in space for hundreds of days — may need to reach further into the depths of space, as the X-37B program is classified under the purview of the Space Force.

“The US government is in this weird place where they brag publicly about how amazing it is and cutting-edge, but will not provide any information about it,” Brian Weeden, the director of program planning at Secure World Foundation, told the Washington Post.

The organization noted that even the program’s budget is a mystery.

5 Much of the X-37B’s use is shrouded in mystery, as the program is classified under the purview of the US Space Force. REUTERS

“The US military openly applauds the program for being a significant success, but does not provide any information about its on-orbit activities,” the Secure World Foundation writes in a fact sheet about the mysterious aircrafts.

“This may indicate they are part of a covert intelligence program, but it may also indicate the testing of offensive technologies or capabilities.”

That “mystique” is adding to the Boeing-produced X-37Bs’ reputation around the world, Weeden said, as the Pentagon tries to make clear it is using the unmanned ships for something very important.

But the Secure World Foundation claims the X-37Bs have “near-zero feasibility as an orbital weapons system for attacking targets on the ground” and concludes that the ships are likely being used for the purposes the Pentagon claims, including “testing reusable space launch vehicle technologies (such as guidance and thermal protection) and on-orbit testing of new sensor technologies and satellite hardware for risk reduction.”

Still, China remains skeptical about the United States’ use of these mysterious crafts — claiming the government is trying to weaponize space.

In response, China created its own secretive reusable spaceplane, the Shenlong, which has flown two missions so far.

The last one reportedly touched down in May after spending 276 days in orbit, but no photos of the Shenlong have been released publicly, according to the Washington Post.

Meanwhile, the X-37Bs have spent a total of more than 10 years in space, which the military says has allowed it to gain information about how different objects survive in space for extended durations.

“It has been a remarkable testbed and experimentation vehicle for many years,” Gen. David Thompson, Space Force’s vice chief of space operations said at a forum earlier this year.

“I would tell you, you’re only beginning to see some of the exciting things that we have planned for the X-37,” he vowed."
79,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,‘Undocumented’ suspect arrested in murder of Texas high school cheerleader Lizbeth Medina,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/undocumented-man-arrested-in-murder-of-texas-cheerleader/,"An “undocumented” man was arrested in the slaying of a Texas high school cheerleader who was found dead in her bathtub last week after missing an event with her squad, police said Sunday.

Rafael Govea Romero was nabbed Saturday in the small city of Schulenburg, Tx. and charged with the murder of 16-year-old Lizbeth Medina in Edna, about 75 miles away, cops said in a statement.

Edna Police Chief Rick Boone said his department and the Texas Rangers caught the “undocumented male subject” after spending “countless hours” on the case, but officials did not reveal the circumstances of the killing, or say if Romero and Medina knew each other.

The teenager was found dead in her home on Dec. 5 by her mother, after failing to march in a Christmas parade with the rest of her high school squad, according to local reports.

The slain girl’s mom, Jacqueline Medina, told KAVU-TV last week that she had discovered Lizbeth in the bathtub of the apartment they shared in the small town in between Houston and San Antonio.

Jacqueline told the outlet she believed her daughter’s murder was tied to a recent break-in at their unit.

“There was no laced drugs, there was nothing like that. My daughter was found in a way that no mother should ever find their child,” Medina told the station.

“Someone hurt my child, someone took my child from me.”

Police had released security footage of the suspect, who was wearing a black “Volcom” sweatshirt and had a distinctive tattoo behind his right ear.

The pictures appeared to match the mugshot of Romero, who was pictured with thick dark hair and sporting a beard sans moustache.

A 23-year-old man by the same name was on probation after being arrested by Schulenburg police for an unspecified second-degree felony, court records show.

“Although Romero is apprehended, we recognize Lizabeth’s family and friends are grieving and still need support from the community,” Boone said in the statement.

“The citizens of Edna can now sleep in peace.”"
80,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"GWU faculty ignore Hamas atrocities, defend attack on Israel: ‘Right of resistance’",https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/gwu-med-faculty-panel-defended-hamas-right-of-resistance/,"George Washington University’s medical school hosted a faculty panel last week that declared Hamas terrorists have a “right of resistance” against Israel, according to video footage exclusively obtained by The Post.

The Dec. 4 discussion was titled “Understanding the Conflict in Israel and Palestine” and was sponsored by the School of Medicine and Health Sciences’ Anti-Racism Coalition and the Institute for Middle East Studies.

Panelists referred to the Jewish state’s military operation in the Gaza Strip as “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide,” while failing to discuss atrocities Hamas committed in its Oct. 7 attack against southern Israel, its designation as a foreign terrorist organization or that it is still holding more than 100 Israeli and US civilians hostage.

“Israel rightly can claim self-defense, but I also want to note here that Hamas and the Palestinians also have a right of resistance,” Michael Barnett, a professor of international affairs and political science, said during the panel.

“All of us have been shaken by the events of Oct. 7,” added Shira Robinson, a professor of history and international affairs. “But we all recognize that those events have a history.”

The Hamas attack ended a cease-fire reached after a May 2021 conflict in which Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel over an 11-day period before a peace was brokered.

Israeli officials estimate that approximately 1,200 people were killed in the Oct.7 attack, including 33 US citizens. Jihadists also took roughly 240 civilians hostage, including approximately 10 Americans — one of whom, 4-year-old Abigail Edan, was released last month.

Israel responded by declaring war against the terror group, carrying out airstrikes and launching a full ground assault in Gaza in a large-scale effort to “demolish Hamas,” according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

At least one GWU panelist affirmed the Jewish state’s right to self-defense, but several went on to characterize the Israel Defense Forces’ actions as part of a larger “colonial” project to ultimately eliminate the civilian population in Gaza.

“Israel launched an unprecedented carpet bombing campaign in the strip that for the past eight weeks, we now know, has deliberately targeted and continues to deliberately target high-rise residential buildings, bakeries, schools, universities, and UN shelters,” Robinson said during the panel.

Hamas is known to use civilians in the region as human shields, placing them in harm’s way by carrying out operations and storing weapons stockpiles at hospitals, schools and mosques — another reality never acknowledged by the panel.

A senior IDF official noted last week that roughly two civilians have been killed in the war for every dead Hamas terrorist, corroborating reports that around 5,000 terrorists and 10,000 civilians have perished in the fighting.

The IDF spokesman pointed out the ratio was “unprecedented in the modern history of urban warfare,” as the Gaza Strip has one of the world’s highest population densities.

Several concerned students and faculty tried to ask questions about the panel’s presentation but were ignored — with some also berated by anonymous users in the chat box during the Zoom meeting.

Jewish students at the medical school were particularly appalled by the panel discussion and told The Post that it had only contributed to the spread of antisemitism on campus that has exploded in the wake of Hamas’ terror attack.

Diversity and Inclusion Dean Yolanda Haywood apologized to the medical school community after the panel, but her statement on the fallout from the discussion neither mentioned Jewish students nor denounced antisemitism.

“The primary goal was to offer an experience that would result in thoughtful reflection and be a stimulus for broader, open communication,” Haywood’s statement read. “As the webinar proceeded, it became clear that this program was not a balanced presentation on this most divisive and difficult subject.”

8 At least 17 antisemitic incidents have occurred on campus this year, according to the AMCHA Initiative, including recent defenses of Hamas by the school’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. provided

Jewish students who spoke with The Post stressed that the statement was part of a pattern of “generic corporate apologies” by administrators who have not “taken any actionable steps to make their Jewish students feel safe on campus.”

“Being a medical student at GW now has made me feel alone and scared for the future of health care,” one said. “I am astonished how a medical school and its students, who dedicate their careers to preserving life, have been silent since Oct. 7.”

“Many of my peers who are passionate about women’s health do not care about the raping, mutilation, and desecration of women’s bodies when it is Jewish women,” the same student added. “My Jewish friends and I have stood with our classmates to amplify the #MeToo movement, abortion rights, and Black Lives Matter. Their silence right now is deafening.

“I am more empowered than ever to become a physician so that I can use my voice to stand up for Jewish patients, because clearly many of my classmates do not care to do the same.”

8 Students projected antisemitic and pro-Hamas messages onto the side of a library building on its campus in Washington, DC, proclaiming “Glory to our martyrs” following Hamas’ attack. provided

Another student pointed out that “in Israel, when medical professionals arrive at the scene of a terrorist attack, they treat the person who is injured the worst.”

“Oftentimes, that is the terrorist themself,” the Jewish student said. “This is because we hold the preservation of human life above all else. I thought that is what it meant to be a medical professional, but clearly some of my colleagues do not feel the same way.”

George Washington University has the fourth-largest Jewish student population of any private university in the US — but still registers a high rate of antisemitism and anti-Israel hostility on campus, a 2016 report from Brandeis University found.

At least 17 antisemitic incidents have occurred on campus this year, according to the AMCHA Initiative, including recent defenses of Hamas’ terrorism by the school’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter.

In late October, students projected antisemitic and pro-Hamas messages onto the side of a library building, including “Glory to our martyrs” and “Free Palestine from the river to the sea,” which is widely understood as a call for the eradication of Israel.

The US Department of Education is also investigating a civil rights discrimination complaint against a George Washington psychology professor who allegedly harassed Jewish students with antisemitic comments during a mandatory diversity course — and then retaliated against them for reporting her to administrators.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) wrote to GWU President Ellen Granberg in October, urging her to “take immediate disciplinary action against those who projected antisemitic messages on campus buildings.”

“Jewish students do not feel safe on their own campuses, and I am appalled that university presidents and administrators, including at GW, have yet to forcefully condemn Hamas terror and vile speech by student groups,” Gottheimer said at the time.

“You have not only a responsibility, but an obligation, to protect all students, including Jewish students, and ensure they can safely remain part of the campus community.”

“GW has repeatedly condemned Hamas and their horrific Oct, 7 terror attack on Israel,” a university spokesperson told The Post Sunday.

“While faculty and students at GW have the right to freely express their own views, they do not speak on behalf of the University. Most issues, including this one, are the topic of a variety of events from different perspectives, and many events and discussions do not — and cannot be expected to — reflect all sides of every issue.”"

Gary Fire Department shared pictures of flames shooting through the old Ralph Waldo Emerson High School on Facebook. The department was assisted by firefighters from Merrillville and Munster.

“This is so sad. I am forever [an] Emersonian,” one woman wrote in response.

“Gone but your memories will forever live in our hearts. Class of 71,” another former student wrote.

The school was the first high school built in Gary, Indiana, according to Ball State University.

It was constructed in 1909, and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1995.

Some say the building stood vacant for far too long after closing in 2008.

“Ok time for demolition don’t let it sit there abandoned and now burnt for another 25 years,” one man wrote in response to the fire department’s post.

“They should’ve just let it melt on down… it was time,” another said.

The building had seen vandalism and even crime over the years, according to reports.

A 17-year-old Chicago girl’s body was found strangled in the former high school in the 700 block of East 7th Avenue in 2015, ABC Chicago reported.

Gary Fire Department told the TV station the fire was put out about 3:45 a.m. Sunday, and a large collapse of the building occurred.

Jevin Allen, 17, and his brother Jarrick Allen, 22, who also allegedly participated in the beating, were arrested Dec. 5 for the assault that left the coach with injuries to his head, neck, face and arms, authorities said.

The coach, who was not identified by name, told the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office that Jevin was benched during the away game “due to his behavior toward an opposing team player” — a disciplinary action that “infuriated” the teen and his family.

Upon returning to their school, Willis High School in Conroe, Tx. at around 9:52 p.m. after the game, the coach found the teen and his family were waiting for him in the parking lot, authorities said.

The relatives confronted the coach, and the fight escalated when Jevin allegedly punched him in the face, the sheriff’s office said.

His brother immediately joined in, with the two pummeling the victim until another coach and several bystanders stepped in to break up the fracas, authorities said.

Both suspects ran off after the attack, police said. After viewing surveillance footage and speaking to witnesses, deputies found and arrested the brothers, who were charged with assault on a public servant.

They were released from Montgomery County Jail after posting $23,000 bond each.

The coach is recovering from his injuries, and Jevin is no longer enrolled at the school, according to a statement the district provided to KHOU.

“The investigation is ongoing, but we did determine that the student’s address was no longer valid, so he has been withdrawn from the district. We are deeply saddened by this incident and will not tolerate this behavior from students,” the statement said.

McCarthy (R-Calif.) was resolute that Trump will be the GOP nominee in an interview that aired Sunday.

“Yes. And if Biden stays as the nominee for the Democrats, I believe Donald Trump will win,” the Californian told “CBS Sunday Morning” in response to a question about Trump getting the GOP nod.

When asked if that was an endorsement, McCarthy replied that he “will support the president, I will support President Trump.”

Over the summer, McCarthy roiled Trump world by questioning whether the 45th president would be the strongest Republican standard bearer.

He later walked that back and repeatedly talked up the former president, who largely remained on the sidelines during the speakership mutiny in October.

For months, McCarthy repeatedly stopped short of issuing a formal endorsement in the 2024 contest, but made sure to laud Trump.

McCarthy announced last week he will depart Congress by year’s end. He was deposed as speaker in October after eight Republicans staged an uprising with a solid bloc of Democrats to topple him.

When asked about accepting a cabinet post, McCarthy kept the door open.

“In the right position. Look, if I’m the best person for the job, yes,” McCarthy replied.

“I worked with President Trump on a lot of policies. We worked together to win the majority, but we also have a relationship where we’re very honest with one another.”

In that very same interview, McCarthy also cast aspersions on Trump’s message of retribution.

During his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Convention Center back in March, Trump vowed to be “retribution” for his backers.

Since then, Trump has re-upped the “retribution” line repeatedly on the campaign stump.

“He needs to stop that,” McCarthy told CBS about the messaging on retribution. “He needs to stop that.”

McCarthy shrugged off concerns that Trump won’t listen to him and contended that the former president has history in which he will “adapt when he gets all the facts.”

“America doesn’t want to see the idea of retribution,” McCarthy went on. “If it’s rebuild, restore and renew, then I think you’ll see that.”

“I’m not gonna change who I am. And I’m not gonna stop giving him the advice. And look, I lost the job of Speaker. Maybe I don’t have the best advice. But I know one thing is, I love this country.”

Late last month, McCarthy appeared to dangle former South Carolina Gov. and US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley as a vice president pick for Trump.

“If I was picking for purely political decisions — what it looks like today is the anti-Trump vote is going to Nikki Haley,” McCarthy said at the New York Times’s 2023 DealBook summit.

“But the question is: Who you select, will they serve? So that’s another question you have to have. And it’s about addition.”

McCarthy also blasted Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) who led the crusade to oust him.

“I think history will show who Matt Gaetz really is,” McCarthy said, declining to state whether he will back a primary challenge against him."

The growing gap between Trump and the rest of the GOP field indicates the strategy is paying off, Make America Great Again Inc. argued to The Post.

MAGA Inc. unleashed an onslaught of negative ads targeting the Florida governor in March. In total, the Trump backers have dropped more than $23 million in negative ad spending against DeSantis and another $6 million against President Biden, according to data from Rob Pyers, research director for the California Target Book.

The ads against DeSantis, ranging from the governor’s record on Social Security and Medicare to claims about his “pudding fingers,” correlate to a serious dip in polling support for the candidate many once thought destined to overtake Trump as the GOP standard-bearer.

Trump has risen nearly 15% in the polls while DeSantis has slipped by more than 15% since March, according to polling averages complied by RealClearPolitics.

Trump’s polling rise also corresponds to the first of four indictments against the 77-year-old, which was secured March 30 by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg.

In that case, Trump is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.

Trump also faces indictments related to retaining national security documents, attempting to overturn the 2020 election and trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

Other candidate super PACs have also spent their own share of funds on negative ads, but have failed to move the needle enough to get within striking distance of the former president — opting to target each other instead.

Never Back Down, the main DeSantis-backing super PAC, has spent just over $350,000 against Trump — and $4.5 million on ads targeting 2024 rival Nikki Haley, according to Pyers’ data. Another pro-DeSantis super PAC, Fight Right Inc., has specifically targeted Haley with over $1.7 million in negative ads.

Haley’s super PAC, SFA Fund Inc., has targeted DeSantis with over $4.9 million worth of spending as the ad wars between the two expand.

In total spending, the DeSantis campaign and its backers have spent $50.8 million, Haley’s campaign and her backers have spent $39.1 million and MAGA Inc. and the Trump campaign have spent $38.3 million, according to data from AdImpact.

“While other groups have lit donor money on fire in their pointless competition for first loser, MAGA Inc. has effectively supported the re-election of President Trump, who is leading in every poll by historic margins,” spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told The Post. “We will continue to be thoughtful stewards of the investments made into MAGA Inc. and accomplish our ultimate goal of winning back the White House next November.”"
85,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Philippines says Chinese coast guard fired water cannons against its ships delivering supplies off disputed shoal,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/philippines-says-china-used-water-cannons-against-its-vessels-for-a-second-day/,"MANILA, Philippines — The Chinese coast guard targeted Philippine vessels with water cannon blasts Sunday and rammed one of them, causing damage and endangering Filipino crew members off a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, just a day after similar hostilities at another contested shoal, Philippine officials said.

The Philippines and its treaty ally, the United States, immediately condemned the latest confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal, where two Philippine navy-operated supply boats and two Philippine coast guard escort ships had sailed to deliver food and other supplies to Filipino forces in a long-marooned navy ship that serves as a territorial outpost.

“We condemn, once again, China’s latest unprovoked acts of coercion and dangerous maneuvers against a legitimate and routine Philippine rotation and resupply mission to Ayungin Shoal that has put the lives of our people at risk,” a Philippine government task force that deals with the territorial disputes said in a statement, using the Filipino name for the shoal.

The Chinese coast guard’s high-pressure water cannon blasts disabled and severely damaged the engines of the Philippine supply boat M/L Kalayaan, which had to be towed back to the western Philippine province of Palawan, Philippine officials said, adding the action seriously endangered the lives of the crew.

One of two Philippine coast guard escort ships, the BRP Cabra, sustained damage to its mast due to the water cannon blast.

Another supply boat was rammed by a Chinese coast guard ship but still managed to maneuver away and deliver supplies to Filipino marines at Second Thomas Shoal, they said.

Drone video footage and photographs issued by the Philippine coast guard show two Chinese coast guard ships separately blasting water cannons at close range at BRP Cabra and a smaller supply boat.

“The systematic and consistent manner in which the People’s Republic of China carries out these illegal and irresponsible actions puts into question and significant doubt the sincerity of its calls for peaceful dialogue,” it said. “We demand that China demonstrate that it is a responsible and trustworthy member of the international community.”

The Chinese coast guard said it had “implemented controls in accordance with laws and regulations.” The statement gave no details about the measures taken but said the Philippines action “seriously infringed on China’s sovereignty.”

It also claimed a Philippine vessel ignored warnings and in violation of international navigation regulations made a sharp turn in an “unprofessional and dangerous manner” and intentionally collided with a Chinese coast guard ship, causing “scratching.”

“The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side,” the coast guard said.

Coast guard spokesperson Gan Yu described China’s actions as “reasonable, legal and professional,” and said such operations would continue unabated.

“We sternly warn the Philippines to immediately cease its infringing actions … and strictly control its provocations on the front line so as not to drop a stone on its own foot,” Gan was quoted as saying on the coast guard’s website.

China’s actions were strongly condemned by foreign diplomats in the Philippines, including the ambassadors from treaty partner the U.S., the European Union and Japan.

“The U.S. stands with the Philippines and partners in vehemently condemning the PRC’s repeated illegal and dangerous actions against vessels,” U.S. Ambassador MaryKay L. Carlson posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

China’s ships, which have surrounded the Philippine-occupied Second Thomas Shoal for years, have blocked Philippine coast guard and supply boats in a yearslong effort to take control of the hotly disputed atoll claimed by both nations.

China has rejected all international condemnation and attempts at legal intervention, including a 2016 ruling by a U.N.-backed arbitration tribunal that invalidated China’s claims, leaving them without any legal basis. China insists it has a legal right to “defend its sovereignty” in keeping with its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, one of the world’s most crucial waterways for shipping and other maritime activities.

On Saturday, the Chinese coast guard and accompanying ships also trained water cannons at three Philippine fisheries vessels to prevent them from approaching Scarborough Shoal in the disputed waters off the northwestern Philippines.

That caused “significant damage” to the communication and navigation equipment of one of the three Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessel, Philippine officials said. They added that suspected militia vessels accompanying Chinese coast guard ships used a long-range acoustic device that could impair hearing, causing “severe temporary discomfort and incapacitation to some Filipino crew.”

In other high seas clashes this year, Chinese coast guard ships used a military-grade laser that caused Filipino crewmen temporary blindness and engaged in dangerous blocking and shadowing maneuvers that caused minor collisions, Philippines officials say.

More tensions loom.

“The Philippines will not be deterred from exercising our legal rights over our maritime zones,” the Philippine government task force said.

A flotilla of 40 civilian fishing boats, backed by Philippine coast guard escort ships, initially was en route Sunday to Second Thomas Shoal but decided to proceed first to two Philippine-occupied islets in the South China Sea to deliver Christmas food packs.

From there, organizers will reassess before the flotilla proceeds with a plan to sail along the vicinity of the Second Thomas Shoal, said one of the organizers, Rafaela David, who denounced the latest Chinese action."
86,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,VA Dem featured in streamed sex acts online says she’s the victim: ‘Entire life was rocked’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/va-democrat-featured-in-streamed-sex-acts-online-says-shes-the-victim/,"A Virginia Democrat who was featured in more than a dozen video streams of her and her husband having sex online for “tips” is speaking out, claiming to be a victim of an invasion of privacy by Republican operatives.

In a recent interview with Politico, former Virginia House of Delegates candidate Susanna Gibson spoke about how she felt about the explicit videos surfacing ahead of her election loss earlier this year.

“It is a feeling that I would not wish on my worst enemy,” the Democrat, nurse practitioner and mother of two, told the outlet.

Gibson made waves in September after archived livestream videos of her having sex with her husband resurfaced and circulated online.

The Washington Post broke the story, reporting that the couple solicited payments from viewers in exchange for specific acts.

The Post headlined the story: “Va. Dem. House candidate performed sex online with husband for tips.”

Gibson and her husband were featured in more than a dozen videos that were archived on a site called Chaturbate in September 2022, which is after she officially entered the race for delegate, and the most recent videos were archived on Sept. 30, 2022.

Once news broke and Republican operatives shared the story ahead of election day, Gibson insisted that she was the victim of “an illegal invasion of my privacy designed to humiliate me and my family.”

She continued to stay in the race, until she lost.

3 Gibson said her entire life was “rocked” after the initial Washington Post article was published.

In her recent interview with Politico, Gibson maintained that she was the victim of a media hit job and illegal distribution scheme of the videos.

Mentioning the Post’s story from September, she said, “My entire life was rocked on Sept. 11, when the article ran. It ran, implying that I performed sex acts online with my husband for money. It was really written based on this Dropbox file that self-described Republican operatives shopped around.”

Gibson spoke to Politico about feeling blindsided: “They had found these videos on the dark web and shopped them around to various news outlets. I didn’t have any idea that there were ever videos of me that had been made and uploaded to multiple sites,” she said.

Gibson added, “When you find out that there are sexually explicit videos of you online, especially by being contacted by national reporters — it is a feeling that I would not wish on my worst enemy.”

As far as her claims of the videos being spread illegally, she said, “Content that is initially made in a consensual context, which is then distributed in a non-consensual context digitally, is a crime.”

Speaking of her actions versus Republicans spreading info about her explicit content, she opined, “Choosing to share content, online or in whatever medium, with select people with the understanding that it will disappear and can only be seen by those present at the time — when we’re talking live streaming, webcamming and Skype — that is a far cry from consenting for that content to be recorded and then broadly disseminated. And there is case law precedent confirming this.”

She also told the outlet, “I think what people do in their private lives, digitally — if it is legal, it is consensual and has no bearing on their ability to do their jobs — I think there should be a barrier. I think that it is unethical to make people’s private lives — especially their sexual private lives — public and part of how we think about them and their ability to do their jobs and make positive contributions to their communities.”

Gibson also warned that other women will soon be victims of the same sort of scrutiny, saying, “I think this is going to continue to happen as millennials age into running for office. There was a 2014 study conducted by McAfee that said or showed that 90 percent of millennial women have taken nude photos at some point.”"
87,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Elon Musk restores X account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after user poll,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/elon-musk-restores-x-account-of-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones/,"Elon Musk has restored the X account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, pointing to a poll on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that came out in favor of the Infowars host who repeatedly called the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax.

It poses new uncertainty for advertisers, who have fled X over concerns about hate speech appearing alongside their ads, and is the latest divisive public personality to get back their banned account.

Musk posted a poll on Saturday asking if Jones should be reinstated, with the results showing 70% of those who responded in favor. Early Sunday, Musk tweeted, “The people have spoken and so it shall be.”

A few hours later, Jones’ posts were visible again and he retweeted a post about his video game. He and his Infowars show had been permanently banned in 2018 for abusive behavior.

Musk, who has described himself as a free speech absolutist, said the move was about protecting those rights. In response to a user who posted that “permanent account bans are antithetical to free speech,” Musk wrote, “I find it hard to disagree with this point.”

The billionaire Tesla CEO also tweeted it’s likely that Community Notes — X’s crowd-sourced fact-checking service — “will respond rapidly to any AJ post that needs correction.”

It is a major turnaround for Musk, who previously said he wouldn’t let Jones back on the platform despite repeated calls to do so. Last year, Musk pointed to the death of his first-born child and tweeted, “I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame.”

Jones repeatedly has said on his show that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six educators never happened and was staged in an effort to tighten gun laws.

Relatives of many of the victims sued Jones in Connecticut and Texas, winning nearly $1.5 billion in judgments against him. In October, a judge ruled that Jones could not use bankruptcy protection to avoid paying more than $1.1 billon of that debt.

Relatives of the school shooting victims testified at the trials about being harassed and threatened by Jones’ believers, who sent threats and even confronted the grieving families in person, accusing them of being “crisis actors” whose children never existed.

Jones is appealing the judgments, saying he didn’t get fair trials and his speech was protected by the First Amendment.

Restoring Jones’ account comes as Musk has seen a slew of big brands, including Disney and IBM, stop advertising on X after a report by liberal advocacy group Media Matters said ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts.

They also were scared away after Musk himself endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in response to a post on X.

The Tesla CEO later apologized and visited Israel, where he toured a kibbutz attacked by Hamas militants and held talks with top Israeli leaders.

But he also has said advertisers are engaging in “blackmail” and, using a profanity, essentially told them to go away.

“Don’t advertise,” Musk said in an on-stage interview late last month at The New York Times DealBook Summit.

After buying Twitter last year, Musk said he was granting “amnesty” for suspended accounts and has since reinstated former President Donald Trump; Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, following two suspensions over antisemitic posts last year; and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was kicked off the platform for violating its COVID-19 misinformation policies.

Trump, who was banned for encouraging the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, has his own social media site, Truth Social, and has only tweeted once since being allowed back on X."
88,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Mitt Romney opposes Biden impeachment probe while ripping Hunter as ‘unsavory person’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/mitt-romney-opposes-impeachment-probe-into-biden-breaks-with-liz-cheney-on-trump/,"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Ut.) on Sunday came out in opposition to the House GOP-led impeachment inquiry into President Biden — while blasting first son Hunter Biden’s behavior and ripping him as an “unsavory person.”

Romney, who voted to convict then-President Donald Trump during both of his impeachments, argued that there isn’t evidence to go after Joe Biden.

“I think before you begin that impeachment inquiry, you ought to have some evidence — some inclination that there’s been wrongdoing,” Romney said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“If I was in the House, I’d vote against it, unless they were able to bring forward evidence that suggests that there were a high crime or misdemeanor that had been committed, but so far, that hasn’t been the case,” Romney said.

The Utah senator, who announced he won’t see reelection in 2024, contended that Hunter’s conduct isn’t enough to go after the president.

“Fortunately, for most people, we’re not responsible for the misdeeds of our kids and grandkids,” Romney said. “We’re not going to impeach somebody because of the sins of their kids.”

House Republicans opened the inquiry into the president back in September under then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)

That probe was not formally authorized via a House floor vote, but Republicans have signaled their intention of making the inquiry official soon.

Due to the lack of a floor vote, the White House has panned the probe as “unconstitutional.”

Meanwhile, the three-committee inquiry has slapped key players, such as the president’s brother James Biden and son Hunter Biden, with subpoenas.

James Biden missed the deadline for testimony last week.

Republicans have demanded Hunter Biden appear this Wednesday and have threatened to hold him in contempt if he does not.

The first son’s lawyer offered to make a public appearance, but Republicans slapped down that offer, pushing for a closed-doors hearing.

Hunter Biden was hit with nine tax-related charges — three felonies and six misdemeanors — last Thursday, an indictment that came on top of the three gun raps to which he’s pleaded not guilty.

White House spokesperson Ian Sams amplified Romney’s remarks, reposting a clip of the interview on X — while claiming something “sinister” was at play and accusing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and her kindred spirits of being a driving force behind the impeachment inquiry.

“I think it’s easy to sort of laugh and chuckle at this bungling exorcise by House Republicans trying to impeach the president over nothing,” Sams told MSNBC on Sunday.

“They want to overturn what happened in 2020 and they’re using their power to launch these baseless political attacks against the president,” he added. “Marjorie Taylor Greene and that same far-right faction are starting to come at him (House Speaker Mike Johnson).”

Romney, during the “Meet the Press” segment, also broke from former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who has opined that Trump, 77, would refuse to leave office should he be granted a second term in 2024.

“I don’t think Donald Trump would want to stay in longer than four years. And the reason I say that is because I think he’s running for retribution,” Romney said.

During a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) earlier this year, Trump vowed to be “retribution” for his disciples.

“I think he will finish his retribution after four years if he’s elected. I don’t think he particularly likes being around the White House. I think he’d rather be back at Mar-a-Lago,” Romney said.

“He wants to show that he’s not a loser, he won. And he wants to go after the people who are tough on him.”

The senator and former 2012 GOP presidential candidate, cautioned against taking Trump’s words too seriously, likening him to a “human gumball machine.”

“A thought or a notion comes in and it comes out of his mouth. There’s not a lot of filter that goes on,” Romney said. “He just says whatever. I don’t attach an enormous amount of impact to the particular words that come out.”

Romney also weighed in on the 2024 GOP contest, re-upping his opposition to Trump, but fretted that endorsing someone would be the “kiss of death.”

“I think Donald Trump recognized if he went through the debate with Chris Christie, Chris Christie would reveal him for what he was,” Romney said.

Trump skipped all four GOP primary debates thus far, citing his colossal lead every poll.

“Nikki Haley, she’s rising right now. I think she’s the only one that has a shot becoming the nominee other than President Trump— it’s a long shot in her part,” he added.

Romney teased that after retiring from the Senate at the end of his term in early 2025, he may go work on helping his wife Ann’s efforts on backing neurologic research.

Ann Romney suffers from multiple sclerosis, which impairs the nervous system’s ability to send certain signals causing ailments such as vision issues and muscle pains.

“Life is so fantastic. It’s so wonderful being alive. And I don’t worry about my next chapter,” the senator added."
89,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Harvard, MIT presidents face increased calls to ‘do the right thing’ after UPenn’s Magill resigned over response to antisemitism",https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/upenn-president-liz-magills-resignation-spurs-celebrations-and-outrage/,"Former University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill’s resignation has been met with celebration — and calls for the heads of Harvard and MIT to also step down over their failures to condemn antisemitism on campus.

Many saw Magill’s resignation on Saturday as the beginning of woke university presidents facing consequences for failing to condemn student calls for the genocide of Jews — though others believed it was a win for the censorship of pro-Palestinian voices.

“One down. Two to go,” New York Rep. Elise Stefanik posted on X following Magill’s announcement.

“@Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing,” the Republican wrote. “The world is watching.”

Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, grilled Magill, alongside alongside Harvard University President Claudine Gay and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth during the tense hearing last week.

She said Magill’s resignation was “only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America.”

Stefanik also warned that Harvard and MIT can now “anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions’ negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, funding and overall leadership and governance.”

6 MIT President Sally Kornbluth also is a target of critics after her testimony before Congress. AP

The organization StopAntisemitism called Magill’s resignation “great news.”

It said her ouster came after Magill allowed “the once prestigious university to fall into a chaotic cesspool of Jew hatred this past year.”

Stay on top of news out of the Israel-Hamas war and the global surge in antisemitism with The Post’s Israel War Update, delivered right to your inbox every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

“Let’s hope Harvard’s President Gay is next,” StopAntisemitism posted on X.

Billionaire Bill Ackman, who has called for Magill, Gay and Kornbluth’s resignations, celebrated the news of Magill stepping down by saying that “morality has spoken.”

He previously said there is “hope for UPenn” if Magill resigns.

Billboard trucks calling for Gay to be fired were seen circling the Massachusetts campus on Sunday.

The privately-funded trucks read “FIRE GAY” and were accompanied by photos of Gay during her appearance before Congress, according to Fox News.

The three university presidents, during the hearing, repeatedly skirted Stefanik’s direct question asking whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate their schools’ codes of conduct.

Magill infamously replied that “it is a context-dependent decision.”

Gay apologized for her remarks in an interview with school newspaper The Harvard Crimson on Thursday, and said she had the support of the Harvard Corporation, which had not publicly commented on the calls for her resignation.

It and the school’s Board of Overseers — Harvard’s governing bodies — convened Sunday to discuss Gay’s leadership, the backlash to her testimony and whether the university should issue a public statement, according to the Crimson.

The executive committee of the MIT Corporation, meanwhile, said Kornbluth had their “full and unreserved support” in a statement Thursday.

Liyam Chitayat, and Israeli PhD student at MIT, gave an impassioned speech calling out Kornbluth for her comments and the executive board for its response.

“Since the executive board responded to this pathetic congressional hearing of our President Sally Kornbluth by stating that they support Sally for her ‘excellent moral compass,’ I have to ask all of you about this continuous obsession with context,” Chitayat said in the speech, a video of which was posted online Saturday night.

“I want someone to tell me, when is the right context to come and urinate on the window of the prayer room at MIT Hillel in front of the Jewish praying students inside there?” said Chitayat, while highlighting some of the antisemitic attacks Jewish students at MIT have recently endured.

“Tell me when is the right context to respond to reports of students facing blatant antisemitism by telling them, ‘Well, you can try talking to the police, you can go to therapy or you can go back to where you came from?’” she continued. “I want to know when a dozen students are allowed to storm in and harass individual staff members that work, or are Jewish and are Israeli.”

“Somehow, there’s a context in which you can tell Jewish students not to come to the entrance of MIT and go to the back door to their classes,” Chitayat, a doctoral student studying computational and systems biology at MIT, added.

“There is context where it makes sense that 70% of Jewish students at MIT do not show any sign that they’re Jewish because they’re scared. There is a context where a chaplain advisor is allowed to stop an event four times to say that Israelis are European racists, white colonizers, right before asking who in this room eats kosher.”

Chitayat went on to say that she sees the faces of some of the Israelis taken hostage by Hamas in those of her own family, and when she looks in the mirror, “I see the face of Naama Levy, who was seen being dragged through the streets of Gaza with blood gushing through her thighs.”

She then turned her attention to Kornbluth and Gay, addressing them both by name as she asked: “When you look in the mirror what do you see?”

Others have taken Magill’s resignation and the push for the other school presidents to step down as censorship for pro-Palestine protests, which have persisted on the Pennsylvania campus and others around the US, with protesters chanting, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — a chant many claim is calling for the elimination of the Jewish state of Israel.

6 Reporter Alex Kane said the push for Magill’s resignation was “not solely” about her comments. alexbkane.com

Alex Kane, a reporter with “Jewish Currents” magazine claimed that the push for Magill’s resignation is “not solely” about her, posting that: “The main story is a McCarthyist atmosphere consuming college campuses over calls for Palestinian liberation.

“Magill tepidly defended free speech for Palestinian advocates, then made a big PR misstep and fell into a right-wing trap,” he claimed.

“Al Jazeera” reporter Laila Al-Arian noted that Magill had been facing criticism for months — ever since the university hosted a “Palestine Writes” festival, which featured a speaker who called for “death to Israel” and another who had worn a Nazi-inspired outfit.

“The President of [UPenn] Liz Magill was under attack for months for simply allowing a literary festival called ‘Palestine Writes’ that featured writers, scholars and artists to take place on campus,” Al-Arian wrote. “The efforts to shut down and censor Palestinian voices are relentless.”

Magill had been under increasing pressure from both donors and lawmakers when the Ivy League school suddenly announced her resignation on Saturday.

Scott L. Bok, chairman of its board of trustees, said both he and Magill had “voluntarily” resigned their posts, noting Magill would stay on until an interim president was appointed, with a plan for new leadership to be announced in the coming days.

Bok also defended Magill, saying she simply “made a very unfortunate misstep — consistent with that of two peer university leaders sitting alongside her — after five hours of aggressive questioning before a congressional committee.”

He went on to praise the ousted president as a “very good person and talented leader” who “is not the slightest bit antisemitic.”

Bok also claimed Magill was “worn down by months of relentless attacks” and “provided a legalistic answer to a moral question” that “made for a dreadful 30-second sound bite in what was more than five hours of testimony.

“Following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable, and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit,” he said in a statement to The Daily Pennsylvanian.

A source close to situation previously told The Post that the mood was sad Saturday as 27 Penn trustees met for two hours without Magill’s or Bok’s knowledge and decided to recommend that she consider resignation.

The Post has reached out to other board members for their reactions as well.

Jewish leader Julie Platt is now taking over as chairman of the board of trustees until a permanent replacement can be found.

“As current vice chair, Julie was the clear choice for agreeing to serve in this capacity during this time of transition,” the executive committee of the Board of Trustees said in a statement to The Daily Pennsylvanian.

In her acceptance, Platt touted her work to end antisemitism on campus

“As vice chair of the university’s board these past several months, I worked hard from the inside to address the rising issues of antisemitism on campus,” Platt said, according to the Jerusalem Post.

“Unfortunately, we did not make all the progress that we should have and intended to accomplish.”

Platt — the mother of actor and singer Ben Platt — also stressed that she would only serve as an interim chair, as her position as chair of the Board of Trustees for Jewish Federations of North America takes precedence.

“As chair of the Jewish Federation of North America, we are leading the largest mobilization in our history in support of Israel’s right to protect its citizens and against the rise of antisemitism in North America, including staging the largest Jewish rally in American history on the National Mall.

“We will continue this fight with all of our energy.”"

Two to go’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/stefanik-others-take-victory-lap-over-resignation-of-upenn-president/,"Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and other politicians cheered the resignation of University of Pennsylvania’s now-former president Liz Magill, who stepped down following disastrous congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus.

“One down. Two to go,” said Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair who grilled Magill and the presidents of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the tense hearing last week.

“This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America,” she added in a statement.

Magill announced her resignation Saturday, as did University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees Chair Scott Bok.

It came after Magill took heat for ducking questions about whether students who chant in favor of genocide against Jews should be punished during congressional hearing Tuesday.

Stefanik pressed Magill and the other university presidents, Claudine Gay, of Harvard, and Sally Kornbluth, of MIT, about student chants, including for “intifada,” which she noted was a call for “the genocide of Jews.”

Magill later released an apology and clarified that calls for the genocide of Jews are “evil, plain and simple.”

Other politicians on Sunday blasted Magill and her fellow campus leaders for their responses during the jarring hearing.

“Any college president in this country who cannot condemn antisemitism, cannot condemn Jewish genocide, they need to resign or be fired,” Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) told “Fox News Sunday.”

“It’s disgusting. It’s shameful, and it shouldn’t be happening on our college campuses.”

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Ut.) stressed that he wasn’t going to tell the remaining presidents what to do, but called their responses during that congressional hearing an “extraordinary failure.”

“What they did in that hearing was absolutely repugnant, was outrageous, incomprehensible. It would have been violated the very premises of American unity,” Romney told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.

Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who now helms Trump Media & Technology Group, similarly voiced his astonishment at the hearing.

“Seldom do you have a congressional hearing that that results in something happening so quickly,” Nunes told “Sunday Morning Futures.”

“I would give the Republicans a lot of credit here that they actually expose what really is stupidity for some of the smartest well known universities around the country,” he said.

“I’m glad to learn that she will resign,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) simply wrote on X.

“UPenn sacked its pathetic President & now faces a harder choice: (1) Expand speech codes to add antisemitism to the list of viewpoints they already ban, OR (2) Embrace true free speech & abandon censorship altogether. #2 would be admirable, but #1 is where they’ll likely land,” presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy said.

Magill’s resignation came in the context of campus donors becoming squeamish amid mounting backlash to her testimony.

During the exchange, Stefanik drilled down on the Ivy Leagy institution’s policies toward harassment of Jews on campus.

“Calling for the genocide of Jews,” Stefanik asked during the hearing, “does that constitute bullying or harassment?”

“If it is directed and severe, pervasive, it is harassment,” Magill responded.

“It is a context-dependent decision, congresswoman,” she later added.

“That’s your testimony today? Calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the context?” Stefanik shot back.

Following the hearing before the House Education and Workforce Committee to examine the prestigious institutions’ policies toward combating antisemitism on campus, Stefanik demanded the three presidents resign.

Even the White House was seemingly taken aback by the hearing.

“It’s unbelievable that this needs to be said: calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country,” Andrew Bates, White House senior communications adviser and deputy press secretary, said in a statement.

The GOP-led paneled chaired by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) announced Thursday that it will launch a broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses.

This comes against the backdrop of antisemitic episodes on colleges campuses across the country skyrocketing since the Oct. 7 surprise attack from Hamas."
91,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Two more Jewish hate attacks in as many days in NYC: ‘It was a real beating’,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/two-more-jewish-hate-attacks-in-as-many-days-in-nyc-it-was-a-real-beating/,"A Jewish father of five was beaten in front of his own home as his attacker spewed antisemitic vitriol in Brooklyn on Thursday — just two days before another man was robbed of his $2,500 traditional Jewish headpiece in the borough as antisemitism continues to rise across New York City.

Joshua Merenfeld, 40, was dressed in Jewish religious garb and enjoying the first night of Hanukkah when an unknown assailant attacked him and snarled, “Dirty Jew” in the victim’s front yard in Crown Heights.

“It was a real beating,” Merenfeld told NBC 4, noting that he was pummeled repeatedly, knocked over and stomped on. “Definitely doesn’t feel good to have this happen in your own front yard.”

As he was being attacked, Merenfeld said, the assailant “used a bunch of antisemitic terminology and profanities.”

Merenfeld, who now has bruises on his face from the violence, was left on the ground as the suspect snatched his phone and fled.

The masked suspect was later spotted entering the Kingston Avenue and Eastern Parkway subway station.

Merenfeld, who received treatment at Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital, said he was speaking out about the attack given the brazen nature of the assault.

“This is a dangerous person. It didn’t happen at twelve o’clock at night at a back alley somewhere. This happened in front of a well-lit building on Eastern Parkway at seven in the evening,” he told NBC.

Then Saturday, the NYPD released video of another antisemitic incident that occurred in Brooklyn when a 20-year-old Hasidic man was robbed in broad daylight.

CCTV cameras captured the moment the victim was approached by a man on a moped in the Borough Park neighborhood near the intersection of 53rd Street and 11th Avenue at 2:10 p.m.

The Jewish victim, wearing a $2,500 shtreimel – a traditional fur headpiece worn on the Sabbath – could be seen talking to a man in a black helmet and pink long-sleeved shirt.

After their brief interaction, the victim walks away from the suspect, who revs up his moped and approaches the Jewish man again, grabbing his shtreimel and riding away with it.

The NYPD said both cases are currently under investigation and has asked the public’s help to identify the suspects in each incident.

The cases are just the latest in a slew of new antisemitic incidents plaguing New York City, with another case occurring last week when a 66-year-old man was beaten by a male assailant shouting antisemitic bile at a Duane Reade store in Manhattan’s Financial District.

Mayor Eric Adams on Friday addressed the rise in hate crimes during a Hanukkah rally event, noting that the past two months have seen a 250% jump in attacks aimed at the Jewish and Muslim communities. The spike coincides with the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

“In this moment of high tension around the globe, it is more important than ever that we stand together as one, united against the rising tide of hatred and religious intolerance. We’re seeing it, and we’re feeling it,” Adams said at the time.

The mayor noted that the NYPD will remain on high alert throughout the Hanukkah season."
92,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Americans getting tummy tucks in Tijuana plunges thanks to cartel violence,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/americans-getting-tummy-tucks-in-tijuana-plunges-thanks-to-cartel-violence/,"The number of Americans getting tummy tucks in Tijuana has plunged this year thanks to fears of local cartel violence and the rising value of the peso against the dollar, a new report says.

The medical tourism trade in the city in Mexico has dropped by more than half, according to industry leaders to Border Report.

“There’s a lot of bad publicity about the city creating a negative perception,” said Ricardo Vega Montiel, president of the Plastic Surgeons College of Baja. “The government needs to step up and invest in strategic promotions to generate a better image for the region.”

Montiel told the outlet that a whopping 3,000 Americans normally get bariatric surgery in Tijuana each month.

That figure has now dipped to fewer than 1,500, he said.

Crime fears exploded earlier this year when four Americans were kidnapped by cartel members in Mexico in March, with two later found dead.

The group had gone south of the border so one of them could get a tummy tuck.

Financial considerations are also playing a role in the drop in business, industry leaders said.

The Mexican peso has been strengthening against the dollar, giving prospective tummy tuckers less of an incentive to cross the border.

The procedure can cost upwards of $20,000 in America — and has been known to cost less than half that in Mexico.

The downward trend in Tijuana’s medical business is also negatively impacting local hotels, restaurants and commercial areas, business leaders said.

Compounding the issue further is the fact that two dozen Tijuana cosmetic procedure clinics are under investigation for possible malpractice, the businessmen told the outlet.

Two people died from bariatric complications in the border town in July, according to reports.

Two of the Americans who traveled to Mexico from Texas in the March group for cosmetic surgery also died, although they were killed by traffickers after likely being mistaken for Haitian drug dealers.

Washington McGee, Eric Williams, Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were snatched from their car March 3 en route to a medical clinic in Matamoros.

Woodard and Brown were both killed, while McGee and Williams were eventually freed after being held captive.

McGee was the one seeking the tummy surgery.

Montiel said Tijuana is being unfairly pegged as unsafe and that he expects the cosmetic procedure industry to recover.

Tijuana has long been a popular destination for those seeking out the weight-loss measure — with a Facebook group entitled “I Left My Stomach in Mexico” boasting more than 20,000 members.

The footage below captured the moment the dark funnel cloud moves across the horizon, with a neighborhood of standalone homes with vehicles sitting in driveways in the foreground.

Another video showed the tornado forming across from a packed mall parking lot. Buildings are completely dwarfed by the gargantuan gray cloud spinning in the distance.

Below, the tornado was shot moving behind large transmission towers in a field. The texture of the tornado is more apparent in this clip, as the twister’s powerful winds can be seen spinning around its core.

A traffic cam in Clarksville recorded the supercell that produced the tornado. Footage from the camera showed vehicles driving along the roads as if it were any other day.

The sheriff’s office of Montgomery County, where Clarksville is located, released a statement confirming that a tornado touched down in the area of Hand Estates, a neighborhood in the northwestern part of town. They noted damage had been done to several homes.

The office added that they do not have any confirmed casualties or missing people.

The supercell, along with the tornado, were part of a severe weather system that has been sweeping through the mid-South on Saturday. Prior to reaching Clarksville, the thunderstorm is believed to have spun up at least one other tornado in northwestern Tennessee."

Israel has faced rising international outrage and calls for a permanent cease-fire after the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians. Nearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced within the besieged territory, where U.N. agencies say there is no safe place to flee.

The United States has lent vital support to the offensive once again in recent days, by vetoing United Nations Security Council efforts to end the fighting that enjoyed wide international support, and by pushing through an emergency sale of over $100 million worth of tank ammunition to Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked U.S. President Joe Biden for the “important ammunition for the continuation of the war,” and for supporting Israel at the Security Council.

The U.S. has pledged unwavering support for Israel’s goal of crushing Hamas’ military and governing abilities, and returning all the hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.

Hamas and other Palestinian terrorists stormed into southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people and capturing around 240, over 100 of whom were released during a weeklong cease-fire late last month.

In response to the attack, Israel launched an air and ground war that has killed thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, and forced some 1.9 million people to flee their homes.

With only a trickle of aid allowed in, and delivery rendered impossible in much of the territory, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who invoked a rarely-used power last week to call for a cease-fire, said “we are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system.”

“The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for the Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region,” he told a forum in Qatar.

Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, told Israel’s Channel 12 TV late Saturday that the U.S. has set no deadline for Israel to achieve its goals of dismantling Hamas and returning all the hostages.

“The evaluation that this can’t be measured in weeks is correct, and I’m not sure it can be measured in months,” he said.

FIGHTING AND ARRESTS IN THE NORTH

Israeli forces continue to face heavy resistance, even in northern Gaza, where entire neighborhoods have been flattened by air strikes and where ground troops have been operating for over six weeks.

Israel’s Channel 13 TV broadcast footage showing dozens of detainees stripped to their underwear with their hands in the air.

Several held assault rifles above their heads, and one man could be seen slowly walking forward and placing a gun on the ground before returning to the group.

Other videos in recent days have shown groups of unarmed men held in similar conditions, without clothes, bound and blindfolded.

Detainees from a separate group who were released Saturday told The Associated Press they had been beaten and denied food and water.

Israel has not commented on the latest video or the allegations of mistreatment, but government spokesman Eylon Levy said “increasing numbers” of Hamas fighters were surrendering and handing over their weapons, calling it a sign of “collapsing” morale.

Residents said there was still heavy fighting underway in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah and the Jabaliya refugee camp, a dense urban area housing Palestinian families who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

“They are attacking anything that moves,” said Hamza Abu Fatouh, a resident of Shijaiyah. He said the dead and wounded were left in the streets as ambulances could no longer reach the area, where Israeli snipers and tanks had positioned themselves among the abandoned buildings.

“The resistance also fights back,” he added, saying gun battles had raged late Saturday.

Israel ordered the evacuation of the northern third of the territory, including Gaza City, early in the war, but tens of thousands of people have remained there, fearing that the south would be no safer or that they would never be allowed to return to their homes.

Heavy fighting was also underway in and around the southern city of Khan Younis.

WAITING FOR FOOD

In central Gaza, hundreds of Palestinians waited for flour outside an U.N. distribution center. The price of food has soared as much of the territory faces severe shortages. Abdulsalam al-Majdalawi said he has come every day for nearly two weeks, hoping to get food for his family of seven.

“Every day, we spend five or six hours here and return home (empty handed),” he said. “Thank God, today they drew our name.”

With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,700, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

The military says 97 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive.

Palestinians terrorists have also continued firing rockets into Israel.

Netanyahu’s office said Sunday that Hamas still has 117 hostages, as well as the remains of 20 people killed in captivity or during the Oct. 7 attack.

The terrorists hope to exchange them for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

Israel says it has provided detailed instructions for civilians to evacuate to safer areas, even as it continues to strike what it says are terrorist targets in all parts of the territory. Thousands have fled to the southern town of Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt in recent days — one of the last areas where aid agencies are able to deliver food and water.

The war has raised tensions across the region, with Lebanon’s Hezbollah trading fire with Israel along the border and other Iran-backed terrorist groups targeting the U.S. in Syria and Iraq.

France said one of its warships in the Red Sea shot down two drones that had approached it from Yemen, where Iran-backed Houthi rebels have vowed to halt Israeli shipping through the key waterway.

Hanegbi said Israel has called on its Western allies to address the threat and would give them “some time” to organize a response. But he said if the threats persist, “we will act to remove this blockade.”"
95,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Donald Trump repeats aspirations to be ‘dictator for one day’ at GOP gala in NYC,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/donald-trump-repeats-aspirations-to-be-dictator-for-one-day/,"Former President Donald Trump pitched himself as a savior for democracy while repeating his claim that he wants to be a “dictator for one day” during a rowdy speech at a GOP soirée in New York City.

Last week, Trump made waves the night before the fourth GOP debate, musing that he didn’t plan to be a dictator, “except for day one” if elected in 2024.

During his headline address at the 111th annual New York Young Republicans Club Gala, which was filled with jokes and Trump’s rhetorical greatest hits from the campaign trail, the 45th president revisited the controversy.

“[Peter] Baker today in the New York Times said that I want to be a dictator,” Trump complained, referencing a report from the news outlet.

“I didn’t say that. I said I want to be a dictator for one day. You know why I wanted to be a dictator? Because I want a wall, and I want to drill, drill, drill,” Trump insisted.

Trump also claimed that the Democrat’s “newest hoax” is to call him a threat to democracy.

The crowed, rife with MAGA stars like Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Col.), applauded him.

Last Tuesday, Trump originally sparked a frenzy about him striving to be a dictator during a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity and said he only wanted it on day one.

“I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill,” Trump said at the time. “Other than that, I am not a dictator.”

His remark drew fierce controversy and came amid frantic warnings from Democrats and disenfranchised Republicans that he aspires to be a tyrant.

His critics have pointed to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots, Trump’s 2020 election denials, and fawning over international dictators as evidence.

“Thank God, only one day,” President Biden joked at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week.

“Sean Hannity actually thought he was helping Trump,” Trump’s ally Steve Bannon complained afterwards. “Even to ask that question shows you’re an idiot. And we don’t have time for idiots, bro. This is a war, and we don’t have time for sunshine patriots and this nonsense.”

At another point in Trump’s wide-ranging address Saturday, the 77-year-old whined about criticism he gets for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping “brilliant.”

“He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. They want me to say he’s just of average intelligence,” Trump said. “I can’t say bad things.”

Trump then suggested that strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin is “sharp,” and gave the same praise to French President Emmanuel Macron.

In that very same speech, Trump also described himself as a defender of democracy, shrugging off criticism that he’s a threat as “misinformation” and a “hoax.”

Trump, who is facing 91 criminal counts, contended that Biden is the “real threat.”

“The radical left Democrats, their fake news allies have unveiled their newest hoax that Donald J. And the Republican Party are a threat to democracy,” Trump bemoaned.

“This is their new line. Here we go again — ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’ ‘Mueller, Mueller, Mueller,’ ‘Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.’ One hoax after another,” he added.

“But no, I’m not a threat. I will save democracy. The threat is Crooked Joe Biden.”

He took aim at rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, needling that California Gov. Gavin Newsom bested him a debate and taking other jabs.

“He looks like a bobble head doll. I don’t like him because I endorsed him and I got him elected,” Trump said.

DeSantis’ campaign generally claims that Trump’s attacks against the governor come from his fear that the Floridian could defeat him — something the Trump campaign rejects.

The Post contacted the DeSantis campaign for comment.

“He (James Donald Hawkins II) said that they had made plans to go to Louisiana to elope, and things were moving faster than they originally expected,” Jackson County Sheriff Captain Kristen Johnson testified, according to WLOX.

Johnson said during her testimony that Hawkins II, 38, had admitted to having sex with the 17-year-old student at his home and in the parking lot of the Ocean Springs Walmart, according to the local news outlet.

Hawkins II, a high school physics teacher in the Ocean Springs school district, was arrested on Nov. 30 and charged with felony sexual battery, according to inmate records.

Law enforcement said that the investigation is ongoing and that more charges could be filed.

“The victim said that it began in the springtime of 2023 before the last school year ended,” Johnson told the courtroom during Hawkins II’s probable cause hearing on Tuesday.

Hawkins II was a high school physics teacher in the Ocean Springs school district. Facebook

“According to Mr. Hawkins, he admitted they had sex approximately one time a month, including at his house and in her car.”

It’s the same home he reportedly lives in with his wife and their toddler, the Sun Herald reported.

The bond was set at $150,000, according to inmate records. The judge also ordered him to stay away from the student and her family.

Hawkins II’s lawyer, Cameron McCormick, and the school district didn’t immediately return Fox News Digital’s request for comment, but the school district told local news outlets after his arrest that he had been fired.

School officials said in a statement that the accusations were “disturbing and intolerable.”

“OSSD is deeply troubled by the arrest and charges announced today by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department involving one of our teachers,” the school district said in a statement.

“James Hawkins was terminated from OSSD when district officials were informed of his arrest and subsequent charges by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department this evening.”"

The unidentified man who donned a black “Volcom” sweatshirt and has a distinctive tattoo behind his right ear, was photographed running, according to surveillance photos.

He was also seen driving a silver Ford Taurus, with model years ranging from 2010 to 2018.

Lizbeth Medina was found unresponsive in the Edna apartment she shared with her mother, Jacqueline, on Dec. 5 after she didn’t show up to a Christmas parade earlier that afternoon.

“I lost it. She was my world, my everything. Everywhere, everything I do was for her,” her mother said.

Circumstances around the teen’s death remain unclear.

“We understand the community wants information in regards to the case, however, we have to keep the integrity of the investigation our number one priority,” the department wrote in a post on Facebook.

The Texas Department of Public Safety is assisting Edna police “in what investigators believe to be a capital murder,” the department said earlier this week.

An autopsy report has yet to be released.

The distraught mother of the bright teenager said upon finding her daughter in the bathtub, she “realized she was gone.”

“There was no laced drugs, there was nothing like that. My daughter was found in a way that no mother should ever find their child,” her mother, Jacqueline, said.

“Words can’t explain what I felt at that moment finding my daughter in the matter that she was. All I can say is that I hope with all my heart that there is justice for my daughter.”

A vigil was held for Medina Saturday at the Jackson County Courthouse, with attendees wearing white in remembrance of the slain cheerleader."
98,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Holiday shoppers warned of disturbing gift card scam likely padding Chinese bank accounts,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/holiday-shoppers-warned-of-disturbing-gift-card-scam-likely-padding-chinese-bank-accounts/,"The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is warning the public of a disturbing and “very sophisticated” gift card scam that has national and international implications.

The sheriff’s office told Fox News Digital this week it carried out a massive anti-retail theft operation at big box stores across the county, netting 285 felony and misdemeanor arrests in seven days.

Among those arrested was a Chinese national who was found to be in possession of thousands of Target and Apple gift cards.

“During our recent retail theft Operation Bad Elf, detectives observed an individual, later identified as Ningning Sun, acting suspiciously near the gift cards in the payment aisles in a Sacramento Target store,” the sheriff’s office said in a press release Wednesday.

The office said investigators witnessed Sun take all the gift cards off a rack in a Target store and put them inside his jacket.

Authorities said the suspect then replaced the missing cards with “another set of seemingly identical ones.”

Members of the sheriff’s office followed the suspect outside, where recently published footage shows detectives surrounding the man to make an arrest.

“That guy blew up like a piñata at a kid’s birthday party, spilling out gift cards from his jacket,” Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Amar Gandhi told Fox News Digital in a phone call this week.

After the arrest, detectives made their way to Sun’s car and found thousands of Apple and Target gift cards.

Gandhi explained that the suspect would obtain legitimate gift cards from store shelves and “surgically remove” the glue that covers the cards’ bar codes.

He would then allegedly record the PINs, re-conceal the bar codes with glue and return the cards to store shelves.

“[The] investigation revealed Sun was part of a scam that tampered with gift cards, scanned the bar code and stole money from the gift card as money was loaded on them. Victims are completely unaware it is happening, and the money is often siphoned to an offshore account within seconds. Their investigation revealed that the operation spanned across California and several regions nationwide,” a press release stated.

After the tampered gift cards were returned to shelves, unsuspecting shoppers would then purchase one of the cards and load funds onto it.

The money, however, would immediately transfer to a bank account, in this case likely a Chinese bank account, Gandhi said.

“It’s going to go unreported because are you going to confront somebody who gave you a $0 gift card? No, that’s rude. And then you’re sitting there fat, dumb and happy, thinking, ‘Oh, I did something nice for somebody,’ not knowing that your money’s gone,” he said.

The office said it has never seen such a crime before, and that Sun is likely a part of a larger gift card operation.

The sheriff’s office is asking the public to come forward with any tips on the case.

Shoppers were warned to keep alert for “any signs of tampering, especially scuff marks or scratches near the bar code,” when purchasing gift cards.

“The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office urges residents to be cautious when purchasing physical gift cards from any retailer,” the sheriff’s office said. “These operations are very sophisticated, and modifications to the gift cards are often virtually undetectable, even to the trained eye.

“Detectives suspect Sun has done this at many stores and are requesting the public’s help to potentially link him to other crimes.”

Authorities are still investigating Sun and his alleged crimes.

Retail theft crimes in California have continued rising in recent years. Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper told Fox News Digital in an interview last month crime is “way beyond crisis level,” while pinning the blame on Proposition 47.

Voters approved Prop 47 through a ballot initiative in 2014, which lowered shoplifting charges for thefts of $950 or less from felonies to misdemeanors.

Cooper is calling for a new ballot initiative to change California laws that “incentivize criminal behavior.”

“Retailers need to step up and make safety in their stores a priority. Bad laws that incentivize criminal behavior need to change, and only you, the voters, can make that happen. I’ve seen the polls. It will pass overwhelmingly if put on the ballot. Retailers, step up and fund the initiative,” Cooper said in a video spotlighting Operation Bad Elf this week."

The opening sketch, set up as a C-SPAN broadcast, tried to poke fun at the presidents of Harvard, UPenn and MIT — portrayed by Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner and Chloe Fineman, respectively — as they testified before the House Education Committee.

There were few laughs to be heard from the audience.

Viewers took to social media to slam the sketch, which some saw as undermining the seriousness of incidents of antisemitism on college campuses in recent weeks since Israel’s war with Hamas began on Oct. 7.

Others thought it was just flat-out bad.

Newcomer Chloe Troast played Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), an outspoken Donald Trump supporter, and targeted her line of questioning during the hearing as the butt of the sketch.

“I’m going to start yelling questions at these women like Billy Eichner,” she says.

“Antisemitism — yay or nay?” she screams at the three women. “Yes or no! Is calling for the genocide of Jews against the code of conduct for Harvard?”

“Well, it depends on the context,” answers Nwodim’s Dr. Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard.

“What? That can’t be your answer,” Troast’s Stefanik shoots back.

“UPenn lady, same question, yes or no?” she asks Gardner’s Magill.

“Well, we are serious about stopping all forms of hatred, anti-semitism, Islamophobia,” she answers. Stefanik then poses the same question to Fineman’s Dr. Sally Kornbluth, president of MIT.

“If you don’t say yes, you’re going to make me look good, which is really, really hard to do,” Troast’s Stefanik says. “So I will ask you straight up. Do you think genocide is bad?”

Fineman’s Kornbluth responds: “Could I submit an answer in writing at a later date?”

“Am I winning this hearing?” an incredulous Stefanik says. “Somebody pinch me!”

The three presidents breathe a sigh of relief when Stefanik learns her time is up, but another member of the committee yields their time back to her, giving her another chance to speak.

“I am here today because hate speech has no place on college campuses. Hate speech belongs in Congress, on Elon Musk’s Twitter, at private dinners with my donors and in public speeches by my work husband, Donald Trump,” Troast’s Stefanik says.

The sketch also ridiculed the vague, evasive answers from the academic leaders.

“Only a hate-filled, anti-Semitic SNL could do a sketch about the anti-Semitic college presidents testifying in front of Congress and make the questioner Congresswoman Stefanik the target of the sketch,” radio host Mark Simone tweeted.

“Rather remarkable how few laughs there were in #SNL’s Cold Open. They – oddly – tried to skewer Elise Stefanik (who by all accounts won the day) as shrill. I guess I was under the misapprehension that calling a woman “shrill” was sexist,” one X user posted.

“The worst cold open on SNL I’ve ever seen the audience was barely laughing,” another wrote.

“Gotta be the worst cold open I’ve ever seen on SNL absolutely abysmal,” another said.

Another user remarked: “SNL is taking a big swing in the cold open and it looks like it’s going to be a miss…”

While largely falling flat, the sketch was somewhat saved by an appearance from show veteran Kenan Thompson, who played the president of the online University of Phoenix.

“Can you take a moral stance on anything? Can anyone here say yes to a single question?” Troast’s Stefanik shouts.

“I am willing to say yes to anything,” Thompson says.

“See, see, finally. A real president of a real university,” Stefanik answers.

“That’s actually our school motto: U of P: We are a real university,” he answers.

Her Stefanik asks if he would promise to eliminate antisemitism from the school’s campus.

“My campus is the internet. Antisemitism is kind of our most popular major, and our mascot is porn,” Thompson quipped.

The real Stefanik, meanwhile, gave a scorching response when news of Magill’s resignation broke.

“One down. Two to go,” the congresswoman posted on X."

Officer Chad Hagan claims the city of Shaker Heights rebuffed his offer of $10,000 to take canine Igor with him when he leaves the department purely out of spite, knowing that the separation would be devastating for both.

The pair have worked together for more than five years, during which time they have formed an unbreakable, familial bond.

“He’s been with us through our first home, our forever home, marriage, having a baby. Been with us through everything,” Hagan’s wife, Danielle, told Cleveland19.

“We’re his only family that he knows.”

The heartbreaking saga began in September when Hagan told his superiors out of respect that he would be looking for job opportunities to move closer to his family, a decision the chief reportedly applauded.

Although Hagan had no job opportunities at the time, Chief Wayne Hudson decided to rip the German shepherd apart from his longtime handler so the K-9 could acclimate to a new officer, according to an online petition.

5 Officer Chad Hagan and his K9 Igor have worked together for more than five years, during which time they have formed an unbreakable, familial bond. Facebook

When Hagan pressed to adopt Igor instead, Hudson allegedly insinuated that he would approve the offer if the pair continued to work in Shaker Heights for another two years.

The desperate handler argued the beloved 6-and-a-half-year-old pooch was nearing retirement and offered to buy him for $10,000 — when the usual price for buying a retired K-9 is $1 — but was briskly shot down.

“This offer was denied, due to a clear act of spite. Chief Hudson stated, ‘it (K9 Igor) is a tool and there is no financial amount that would be considered,'” the petition alleges.

Despite the scathing comments, Hudson allegedly left the meeting by giving Hagan a sense of hope that his mind could be changed.

When Hagan handed in his resignation around Thanksgiving, however, the chief ruined the holiday by ordering the handler to return Igor to a facility.

“Igor is a six-year-old German Shepard and, if his health remains strong, he is expected to be fit for duty, keeping the residents of Shaker Heights safe, for another three or four years. He shows no signs of slowing down,” the city told Ceveland19 in a statement.

Officials asserted that neither Hudson nor the city’s administration have the authority to sell Igor considering his fitness levels.

Other than hoping to retire Igor out of love, the Hagan family argued Igor has slowed down in recent years, estimating he only has a year or two of law enforcement left.

Danielle also claims other nearby communities have let officers purchase canines even after four years for just $1.

5 The Hagan family is the only family K-9 Igor has ever known, a petition read. Facebook

“The Hagan family is the only family K-9 Igor has ever known and instead of being with Officer Hagan and his family for the remaining week and a half, he has been living in a boarding facility, laying on a 4×4 concrete pad because of the retaliation by Chief Hudson,” the petition states.

“The bond that Officer Hagan and K-9 Igor have is beyond what anyone could ever imagine. K-9 Igor has saved Officer Hagan’s life on multiple occasions. K-9 Igor is not a ‘tool.’ He is a beloved member of the Hagan family and Officer Hagan’s best friend. This is truly the worst heartbreak this family has ever been through.”"

Jenny Blalock, 45, and her father James, 78, went down around 11 a.m. and crashed on a remote road in Pulaski, a city on the central-southern border of Alabama, according to federal and county officials.

Their bodies were discovered outside the plane, which landed in a “remote” area that was difficult for crews to reach.

“It was just devastating. It was significant damage again. Unfortunately, there were just no survivors,” Bill Myers, director of the Giles County Office of Emergency Management, told 10 News.

The father-and-daughter pair had traveled 180 miles from Knoxville when the aircraft plummeted, FlightAware data shows. They were roughly 10 miles short of landing at a city-owned airport.

The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but it comes just a month after Blalock — known in the community as TNFlyGirl — posted a video of herself executing an emergency landing during an “aircraft malfunction” from 4,000 feet in the air.

“Are we going to make it?” she eerily asks her flight instructor after he points out the plane’s battery had died mid-flight.

Later, she discovered that the plane also had screws loose on its regulator.

Despite the harrowing ordeal, Blalock remained calm and expertly landed the aircraft without issue.

“God bless and fly safe,” the well-known YouTuber told her 16,000 subscribers.

According to her account, she was a “private pilot, flying for fun in a Beechcraft Debonair.”

Blalock, who also is a luxury home builder and designer, frequently filmed her flying excursions with her father since launching her popular channel in 2021.

Their fatal flight appeared to be one of the first the pair had taken together “in a while,” according to a video Blalock posted in November.

“Jenny and her dad were not just daughter/father, they were best friends and did EVERYTHING together!” her partner, Brett Thees, said on Facebook.

The Blalock family issued a statement saying they take comfort in knowing the father-daughter pair “were together when they met our Lord and Savior!”"

“He’s opened up a Pandora’s box that will never let our country be the same. I can only say to Joe: Be very careful what you wish for, but you have done is a terrible thing,” Trump thundered to roughly 1,000 assembled guests, who dined on wild mushroom risotto and filet mignon.

The swanky event was sponsored by the New York Young Republican Club.

“I am being indicted for you. These are not indictments in the traditional sense. These are Biden indictments against their political opponent,” the 77-year-old 2024 frontrunner said.

Trump faces 91 felony counts from four separate state and federal probes — something he repeatedly bragged about.

“I am the first guy who ever got indicted whose poll number went up,” he said in jest while comparing himself to notorious gangster Al Capone.

Trump vowed to win the GOP primary and the White House in the 2024 presidential election — and said he would even win the deep blue Empire State.

“We’re going to take New York,” Trump said to applause. “I believe we have a great chance … With hundreds of thousands of people living on the sidewalks and streets and illegal aliens invading our city and state like nobody thought possible.”

Trump laced into his political enemies as well, mocking Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as “DeSanctimonious,” and his former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley as “birdbrain.” He savaged New York Attorney General Letitia James as “peekaboo James” and a “vicious lunatic.”

Trump spoke after a lengthy evening which also featured remarks from Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).

About 30 minutes before speaking, Trump enjoyed dinner at a roped-off table and was spotted in deep conversation with New York Young Republican Club President Gavin Wax. He was also briefly treated to a personal serenade from the aptly named Hungarian violinist Zoltan Maga.

Master of Ceremonies Alex Stein made light of Trump’s legal troubles by joking that he hoped the former president went to jail because it would help with “the black vote.”

Among those spotted in a VIP cocktail hour ahead of the ceremonies included Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Col.) and Andrew Giuliani. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also purchased his own table for the event — where individual tickets ran about $700 a head.

New York City GOP Councilwomen Vickie Paladino and Inna Vernikov were also in attendance. Vernikov herself was honored by Trump on stage — who approvingly noted that he kept reading about her in the press.

“That’s why I wanted to see her,” Trump said after exchanging a kiss on both cheeks.

“Well, that was not planned,” Vernikov texted The Post from her table.

Former New England Patriots Defense End Jake Bequette was also on hand, carrying a Super Bowl ring he allowed admirers to pose for pictures with. Vish Burra, a top aide to former Rep. George Santos — who was expelled from Congress last week after a cascading series of corruption allegations — was also spotted schmoozing and defending his former boss, whom he lovingly called “the Princess Diana of our generation.”

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sat at a table with his former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik.

As in years past, the event has an international flair. Miklos Szantho, the head of the right-leaning Hungarian Center for Fundamental Rights, and Hungary’s Ambassador to the US Szabolcs Takács both delivered brief remarks from the main stage."
103,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Memphis family devastated after porch pirates steal grandmother’s ashes,https://nypost.com/2023/12/10/news/memphis-family-devastated-after-porch-pirates-steal-grandmothers-ashes/,"A Tennessee woman is devastated about losing her grandmother for a second time after her ashes were stolen by a porch pirate.

“She was definitely my rock when it came to grandparents. She was there for all the graduations, all the birthdays,” Amy Rost told WREG.

“It’s definitely been difficult. It’s one of those things where we’re trying to weigh the pros of the situation,” Rost said.

Rost’s grandmother died in October. She was cremated, and her ashes were divided between Rost’s father, Jeff, and her aunt, who lives in Ohio, and shipped to Jeff’s home in Memphis’ Midtown neighborhood.

Tracking information showed that the package containing the ashes was delivered on Dec. 4 — but when Jeff went outside to get it off his front porch, there was nothing there.

He believes the irreplaceable package was snatched by a thief.

“We’ve had so many things stolen here. Everything from tables and chairs to a can of Raid. Someone is always coming up and grabbing whatever they can find,” he told the outlet.

Memphis is ranked the second worst city in the country for porch pirates, according to a report by Safewise last month.

Nationally, package thefts have led to losses of up to $6 billion nationwide, if the average package stolen was $50, according to Safewise. Over half of the packages stolen were from Amazon.

The family is now begging for whoever took the box to return it — no questions asked.

“If I saw somebody bring a box up and leave it on the porch, I’ll leave it til they’re gone,” Jeff told WREG. “I’m not trying to prosecute anybody, it’s just it would certainly be nice to have it back.”

The Rosts said they plan to install a security camera to scare off future thieves."

John Whitmire as its next mayor on Saturday night, elevating a Texas lawmaker who has represented the city for 50 years by giving him a victory over US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee in a runoff.

Whitmire, 74, who is one of Texas’ most powerful Democratic legislators, will now be at the helm of America’s fourth-largest city.

His campaign focused on reducing crime, improving streets and bringing people together. He heavily outspent Jackson Lee, who was running to become Houston’s first Black female mayor.

The congresswoman’s campaign also had to deal with the fallout from the release in October of an unverified audio recording that purported to capture her profanely berating staff.

Whitmire built an insurmountable lead among early voters, winning among those voters by 30 percentage points.

Standing before a ballroom full of cheering supporters in the city’s convention center, Whitmire said he was fired up and ready to go to work as mayor.

“I don’t mind telling folks what a great city we have. But we’ve got great challenges. If we will come together and realize it won’t be easy. In fact, we will face challenges. But I see that as an opportunity. And I need you to join hands with me. We’ll meet our challenges. It’ll be an opportunity to show the nation what the city of Houston can do,” Whitmire said.

At her election night party, Jackson Lee thanked her supporters, congratulated Whitmire and said she was committed to working with him. Jackson Lee said she planned to announce in the near future a decision on whether she would run for re-election next year for her congressional seat.

“It’s sweeter to be saying what a sweet victory it is. It’s equally as sweet to acknowledge we put up a good fight,” Jackson Lee said.

Whitmire and Jackson Lee had made it to Saturday’s runoff after emerging from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the Nov. 7 general election.

Both candidates — two of Houston’s biggest political fixtures — touted their decades-long political experience as strong qualifications to lead a growing city facing challenges that include crime, crumbling infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls.

Whitmire started in the Texas Legislature in 1973, first as a state representative and the majority of his time as a state senator. Jackson Lee has represented Houston in Congress since 1995 and, before that, had served on Houston’s City Council.

Booming growth over the last decade has caused municipal headaches but has also turned the Houston area into an expanding stronghold for Texas Democrats. Although the mayoral race is nonpartisan, Whitmire and Jackson Lee are both Democrats.

Whitmire will be the oldest big city mayor in the US. He is set to lead a city that is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35 and with 25% of its population below 18, according to census figures.

The choice between Whitmire and Jackson Lee, who is 73, frustrated some Democratic voters, particularly younger ones, at a time when the party is searching for new political stars in Texas who might end 30 years of GOP dominance statewide.

The new mayor will have to deal with new laws from the GOP-led state government over control of local elections and the ability to impose local regulations.

Whitmire will replace Mayor Sylvester Turner, who has served eight years and can’t run again because of term limits.

Whitmire will also lead what is considered one of the country’s most diverse cities. Of the city’s 2.3 million residents, 45% are Latino, with 23% Black and 24% white. One in every four Houston residents was born outside the US.

Known as the energy capital of the world, Houston’s economy has long been tied mainly to the oil industry. But the city is working to become a leader in the transition to cleaner energy. Like other large US cities, Houston is also dealing with a lack of affordable housing and concerns among residents over growing gaps between the rich and poor."

Laneisha Shantrice Henderson, 26, is a veteran surface warfare specialist in the US Navy and received multiple awards during her service.

Henderson received a National Defense Service Medal and a Good Conduct medal during her service.

She was also given the Navy “E” ribbon, among other awards.

Henderson has been charged with attempted arson and interfering with government property after she was seen on camera pouring the flammable liquid out of a large red fuel container and onto the porch of the historic wooden property at around 5:45 p.m. Thursday.

The footage also shows the woman — who was dressed in all-black clothing — dousing plants and emptying the liquid against the windows of the Auburn Avenue house, which is located just blocks from the King Center, King National Historical Park and the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church.

Zachary Eugene Kempf, from Utah, who shot the shocking video and is one of the two tourists who stopped Henderson, said he was in Atlanta for work reasons when he decided to visit the house.

He began recording this footage as he noticed the woman pouring gasoline around the house.

Taylor Justin Schulz, 44, allegedly brought several items to the counter of Oak Grove Grocery, a small neighborhood store near downtown Minneapolis, just before 1 p.m. before launching the unprovoked attack.

Schulz impaled the 66-year-old employee — identified by the community as dancer Robert Skafte — “through the torso” with the club before fleeing the building, the Minneapolis Police Department said.

Neighbor Tony Gutoski, who happened to walk into the store in the immediate aftermath, said Skafte was conscious and alert despite the brutal injuries.

“He was speaking, he answered questions,” Gutoski told The Post.

“He told me the dude that came in earlier that was acting crazy and yelling about s–t came back and attacked him.”

Skafte was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.

Schulz was tracked down to an apartment across the street, where he had barricaded himself inside.

After a six-hour standoff with negotiators, the SWAT team, the drone unit and the bomb squad, the alleged assailant was taken into custody.

He was booked in the Hennepin County Jail on probable cause murder, records show.

A motive for the gruesome attack is still under investigation, but Gutoski claims Schulz was just “a f–king crazy person” who had called 911 before the attack demanding to talk to the FBI.

“It’s completely f–ked up,” Gutoski said. “[Skafte] was a really good dude, never hurt no one and this guy just ran him through with a golf club … He’s a fixture in the neighborhood.”

Skafte was an avid dancer and well-known in the theater community, neighbors said.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit against Meathead Movers for violating age-discrimination law by not hiring enough older workers, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Since launching in 1997, the Fresno-based company’s mission has been to hire student-athletes. Its social media posts show its youthful, muscled employees lifting weights and lifting boxes.

The employees, dubbed “Meatheads,” annually face off against each other in the Meathead Olympics, racing to assemble and leap over boxes.

During moves, workers are required to run from the moving truck to the home when they’re empty-handed, according to the Journal.

The company states on its website that its “founding principle is to support athletes working in pursuit of their dream career path and that will never change.“

Meathead Movers executives deny that they discriminate against older workers, claiming the job is simply too demanding for those not in tip-top shape.

“We are 100% open to hiring anyone at any age if they can do the job,” company owner Aaron Steed told the Journal. “People love working at Meathead, or they are turned off by how hard it is. You have to move furniture and run to get more.”

The EEOC, chaired by Charlotte Burrows, alleges that Meathead Movers’ marketing and hiring practices discourage older workers from applying, WSJ reported. Current employees are asked to seek new potential hires at local gyms and colleges, the agency claims.

The agency told the outlet that discouragement bias can be present in job ads, marketing materials and intrusive job application questions, like asking about a student’s class schedule.

EEOC has been looking into the company since 2017 on its own and did not stem from a complaint as most of its investigations are. Last year, it received more than 70,000 complaints and filed 91 employment discrimination lawsuits, according to the newspaper.

The two sides tried to negotiate a settlement, with the agency demanding $15 million before lowering that to about $5 million, according to internal emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

Meathead countered with a $750,000 offer to settle. The EEOC filed the suit in September.

“We had no idea we were doing anything wrong by being a moving company that hires a lot of student-athletes,” Steed told WSJ.

“We want to change and evolve, but we can’t agree to go out of business doing it.”

Burrows was appointed chair of the EEOC by President Biden. Since Democrats took control of the agency in August, commissioners have since voted seven times on age discrimination matters. They voted on age issues just three times this year before that.

She has vowed to enforce age-discrimination laws regarding age bias as nearly a quarter of the country’s workforce is aged 55 and older, and the agency appears to be aggressively pursuing age-discrimination cases.

According to the Labor Department, the number of seniors over the age of 65 in the workforce will grow by a third over the next 10 years.

The Post has reached out to the EEOC for comment on the lawsuit.

Advocates for older Americans lauded the agency taking on age discrimination.

“Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is over 50. I’m pretty sure he would be good at moving boxes,” Bill Alvarado Rivera, senior vice president for litigation at AARP, an association for the rights of older people, told the Journal.

“That kind of stereotype about who could be a good mover has no place in an economy that values individuals.”"

The Nashville Emergency Operation Center confirmed on social media that three people were killed by severe storms in the city.

Montgomery County officials said an additional 23 people were hospitalized after the severe storms.

“This is devastating news and our hearts are broken for the families of those who lost loved ones. The city stands ready to help them in their time of grief,” said Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts in a statement.

The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said that a tornado touched down around 2 p.m. A shelter was set up at an area high school as responders searched for victims.

Photos posted by the Clarksville Fire Department on social media revealed the extensive damage the tornado left behind, including ravaged houses, a tractor-trailer flipped on its side on a highway and insulation ripped out of building walls.

Officials asked residents to remain in their homes as the search and rescue operation continues.

In a briefing shared on social media, Pitts said there was extensive damage around the city of about 170,000 people.

“If you need help, call 911 and help will be on the way immediately. But if you can, please stay home. Do not get out on the roads. Our first responders need time and space,” he said.

109,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Stores in crime-riddled San Francisco abandoning self-checkout lanes to combat thefts: report,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/san-francisco-stores-abandoning-self-checkout-lanes-to-combat-thefts/,"Retailers in crime-riddled San Francisco are abandoning their self-checkout lanes in a “defensive retailing” move to counter surging thefts in the city.

A Safeway supermarket in San Francisco’s Fillmore District and a Target on Mission Street closed their self-checkout kiosks to customers — a change that other stores across the troubled city may follow, SFGate reported.

“While I can’t speak for any one company, you see the trajectory of commerce over the last 10, 20, 5,000 years, it’s all about reducing friction for customers,” Daniel Conway, vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, told the outlet.

“But now you’re seeing a countervailing trend: armed guards and Tide Pods locked up,” he added.

Retail thefts and organized “smash-and-grab” robberies in the Golden Gate City — and major cities across the country — have skyrocketed in recent years, forcing many major stores to shut down certain locations.

Target blamed crime for shutting down three stores in San Francisco in September, according to SFGate. In 2021, Safeway said rampant thefts forced a city location to cut employees’ hours.

The Post has reached out to Target and Safeway for comment about the removal of the self-checkout machines as many retailers have linked the do-it-yourself kiosks to rising thefts.

There have been 29,739 cases of larceny and theft in 2023 — significantly down from 2022 when 61,715 were reported, according to the latest data from the San Francisco Police Department,

California announced in September it plans to spend $267 million to help dozens of local law enforcement agencies crack down on smash-and-grab robberies. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said at the time that since 2019, law enforcement in California has arrested more than 1,250 people and recovered $30.7 million in stolen merchandise.

In New York, store owners said they lost $4.4 billion last year as a result of retail theft, according to the The Retail Council of New York State, a lobbying group.

Retailers in other cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, have also been targeted by large-scale thefts when groups of people show up in groups for mass shoplifting events or to enter stores and smash and grab from display cases.

In response, retailers have had to adapt, which may wind up making shopping ultimately more difficult, Conway told SFGate.

“All the things put in place to reduce friction are now being put back,” Conway said. “I can buy whatever I want on my phone, but now when I want to go to a store to buy it, it’s harder.

“It’s difficult to make a direct correlation, but I think in San Francisco it’s getting to the point that you are seeing stores closing, which is the ultimate form of defensive retailing,” she said."
110,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"US OKs $106M emergency tank ammunition sale to Israel, sidestepping congressional review",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/us-oks-106m-emergency-tank-ammunition-sale-to-israel/,"The Biden administration approved an “emergency sale” Saturday to send nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel as it ramps up its invasion of the Gaza Strip.

The State Department approved the massive offloading — worth more than $106 million — in a move that allowed it to circumvent Congress.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the department said in a statement.

“Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense,” it added.

For the price of $106.5 million, Israel will receive 13,981 120 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer tank cartridges as well as US support, engineering and logistics, all of which will come from Army inventory.

Congress was notified of the sale late Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined an “emergency exists” in the Middle Eastern war that would affect US national security interests.

The urgency allowed Biden officials to sell the weaponry without the standard congressional review required for foreign military sales.

Although unusual, the emergency sale is not unprecedented. In 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo similarly sold $8.1 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers’ concerns about the Saudi- UAE-led war in Yemen.

The sale comes days after the Biden administration pleaded for Congress to approve a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs.

A hefty portion of the funding would go toward military and economic assistance in Ukraine, saying Kyiv’s war effort to defend itself from Russia’s invasion may grind to a halt without it.

The administration has faced a difficult reception on Capitol Hill, where there is growing skepticism about the magnitude of assistance for Ukraine and where even Republicans supportive of the funding are insisting on US-Mexico border policy changes to halt the flow of migrants as a condition for the assistance.

The GOP-controlled House has passed a $14.3 billion standalone assistance package for Israel.

More than 1,200 Israelis were killed when Hamas launched its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, and 97 Israel Defense Force soldiers have been killed in the fighting since.

With the war entering its third month, the death toll in Gaza stands at more than 17,400, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.

Truckers started blocking roads to border crossings on Nov. 6, creating lines stretching nearly 20 miles and lasting weeks in freezing temperatures, and hindering the transport of pickup trucks, tourniquets, night vision equipment, drone parts and other materials and medical supplies.

The Polish drivers are protesting competition from Ukrainian counterparts, who they say are undercutting their business amid relaxed European Union transport rules.

“This means that the Russian army will have the ability to kill Ukrainian soldiers and terrorize civilians for several weeks longer,” said Oleksandr Zadorozhnyi, operational director of the KOLO foundation, which assists the Ukrainian army with technology and is unable to get materials through.

Protestors deny holding up aid, according to reports, and the head of a truckers’ association in western Poland said there is no light at the end of the tunnel as authorities are paying little attention.

As the war wages on, Ukrainian authorities are also fighting plans for voting to take place in illegally annexed territories in the planned Russian election in March. The balloting could keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in power until at least 2030.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry is calling on the international community to impose sanctions on those involved with the election.

Separately, Ukraine continued its effort to eliminate Russian influence on the homefront with its campaign to remove Soviet-era monuments. A statue of a Soviet field commander of the Russian Civil War was removed Saturday as “decommunization” efforts have been revamped ahead of the war’s two-year mark.

Bok, chairman of its board of trustees, “voluntarily” resigned their posts Saturday in a massive Ivy League shakeup, the school announced.

“I write to share that President Liz Magill has voluntarily tendered her resignation as President of the University of Pennsylvania,” Bok wrote in a surprise “University Notification” sent to staffers Saturday.

“She will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn Carey Law,” Bok continued.

“On behalf of the entire Penn community, I want to thank President Magill for her service to the University as President and wish her well.

“We will be in touch in the coming days to share plans for interim leadership of Penn. President Magill has agreed to stay on until an interim president is appointed.

“President Magill shared the following statement, which I include here: ‘It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution. It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.’”

Bok’s separate resignation statement was obtained by the Daily Pennsylvanian, the school’s student newspaper.

“Working with [Magill] was one of the great pleasures of my life,” he wrote. “Worn down by months of relentless external attacks, she was not herself last Tuesday.”

Magill’s sudden departure came four days after her Tuesday appearance before the House Education Committee, when she and the presidents of Harvard and MIT were grilled by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) – who asked each of them whether calling for the genocide of Jews is considered to be “bullying and harassment” under their colleges’ codes of conduct.

“It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman,” Magill responded – sparking outrage among donors and others.A source close to situation told The Post that the mood was sad Saturday as 27 Penn trustees met for two hours without Magill’s or Bok’s knowledge and decided to recommend that she consider resignation.

Bok announced his resignation on the spot during a call with trustees, the source said – without giving any warning to vice chairman Julie Platt before hanging up.

Platt will serve as acting chair, and the executive committee will present a “plan forward” on Sunday.

Larry Jameson, dean of Penn’s medical school, was mentioned by some trustees as a possible interim president.

4 The University announced the news in a letter to the Penn community.

Stefanik issued a blistering response as news of Magill’s resignation broke.“One down. Two to go,” the congresswoman posted on X.

“This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America,” Stefanik – a Harvard graduate – wrote.

N12 News shared the clip of the men standing in line across a rubble-strewn street in Jabaliya as IDF soldiers trained automatic weapons on them and ordered them to drop their own weapons across the street. One of the men gingerly crossed the street, his automatic weapon held over his head, before dumping into a pile of seized arms.

“In Shejaiya and Jabaliya, terrorists who surrendered handed over weapons and equipment,” said IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari Saturday, the Times of Israel reported, adding that many of the men told Israeli forces that Hamas leadership underground “does not care about the public in Gaza who are above ground.”

Hagari said that interrogations of the captured operatives already provided valuable intelligence for the Israeli military and “aids us in operational activities.”

Meanwhile, the Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar fled northern Gaza at the beginning of the fighting in October by hiding in a humanitarian convoy heading southward.

Sinwar escaped Gaza City and headed toward south Gaza’s Khan Younis in a vehicle that provided “humanitarian cover,” the report said, adding that more precise details of the vehicle are barred from publication at this point.

The report adds that Israel’s assessment is that Sinwar is still in Khan Younis, or rather in one of the tunnels that run underneath it.

Earlier in the day, the IDF released video of their troops of the Nahal Infantry Brigade’s 931st Battalion battling Hamas in northern Gaza.

“The terrorists prepared an ambush in the area and were prepared to attack our forces when they would have moved through the main road,” the IDF said in a statement. “The forces arrived through one of the alleys, behind the enemy, surprised them and fired at the terrorists.”

The IDF said the Hamas gunmen opened fire at the troops and hurled grenades.

The body of Sahar Baruch, an electrical engineering student kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7 from his kibbutz in southern Israel was featured in a Hamas propaganda video released Friday.

Hamas claimed that he was killed in an Israeli Defense Forces operation to free hostages.

The IDF denied the claims, and said Baruch had been murdered by Hamas.

On Saturday, Baruch’s death was confirmed by members of Kibbutz Be’eri, where he lived with his family, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.

“It is with great sadness and a broken heart that we announce the murder of Sahar Baruch (25), who was kidnapped from his home by Hamas terrorists to Gaza on the Black Sabbath and murdered there,” said the community in a statement.

The Ben Gurion University student’s family are demanding the return of his remains in any future hostage release deal, according to the Jerusalem Post.

Baruch, whose brother Idan was murdered by Hamas during the Oct. 7 massacre, was considered missing for weeks, until his family received the message that he was being held captive by Hamas.

“Sahar was at home with his brother Idan at his mother’s house,” said an aunt in an interview with Israeli media Saturday. “They woke up in the morning, like the rest of us, from alerts and the explosions.They entered and closed themselves in the mamad [protected space] but couldn’t close the door,” so they closed it with a closet” She continued.

“When the fire started, three grenades were thrown into the mamad – Idan was hit and Sahar treated him for hours.”

The brothers decided to jump from the home when it began to burn, the aunt continued. “In the beginning, Idan jumped and probably near that he was shot and killed. Sahar stayed behind for a few more minutes to bring him the inhaler because Idan was asthmatic. For more than two weeks we did not know what happened to him, and then some information was received that he was not in Israeli territory.”

115,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,George Soros funneled more than $50M to Iran-sympathizer groups linked to Robert Malley,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/iran-apologists-linked-to-robert-malley-got-50m-from-soros/,"Far-left billionaire George Soros has funneled more than $50 million to a network of Iran-sympathizer groups whose members have gained significant sway within the Biden White House — pushing to defang US sanctions on Tehran while advocating for a renewed nuclear deal.

A Post examination of Soros’ Open Society Foundations records shows the progressive kingmaker has given a staggering $46.7 million since 2016 to the International Crisis Group, a lefty think tank tied to an alleged Iranian plot to manipulate US policy.

Robert Malley, the former US special envoy to Iran now under FBI investigation for his alleged mishandling of classified material, was the ICG’s president until he joined the Biden administration in 2021.

“Soros has continually funded organizations that act as apologists for the Iranian regime – downplaying their severe human rights abuses while working to advance Iranian propaganda,” Gabriel Noronha of the Polaris National Security think tank told The Post.

Soros cash funded the ICG’s formation in 1994, and the billionaire was a trustee for years before handing the seat to his son and ideological heir Alexander Soros, 38, in 2018.

Three of Malley’s proteges were part of the Iran Experts Initiative, a covert network of Iranian-American academics established by Iran’s Foreign Ministry in 2014, according to Semafor.

Over the last decade, IEI participants have worked their way into Washington’s foreign policy establishment — while subtly persuading US policymakers to ease sanctions on Tehran and accede to its nuclear ambitions.

“If you were a regime running a game plan of how to subvert the United States’ political system from within, this would be it to a tee,” Noronha said.

Malley hired IEI participant Ariane Tabatabai as his top aide when Biden tapped him to lead the US team charged with negotiating a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Tabatabai then switched to a high-level job at the Pentagon with a top security clearance, where she remains, drawing Republican ire.

Ali Vaez, another IEI member and currently the director of Iran projects at ICG, reportedly sent some of his writings to Iranian officials for pre-publication review. Vaez has scored five White House meetings with Biden’s top national security officials, visitor logs show.

Malley hired Dina Esfandiary, a third IEI member, as a senior ICG advisor. In 2021, she and Vaez co-authored an essay cheering the election of Iran’s hardline president Ebrahim Raisi as “a real opportunity to make progress on the nuclear talks.”

Malley’s 2021 appointment coincided with the administration’s turn from former president Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Biden’s lax enforcement has reportedly earned the mullahs an estimated $95 billion.

In February 2023, Vaez scored two lengthy one-on-one meetings with Brett McGurk, Biden’s coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, while McGurk was secretly negotiating with his Iranian counterpart to restart the nuclear talks.

Soon after, the administration made a controversial deal to release $6 billion of frozen Iranian funds in exchange for five American hostages.

Meanwhile, Malley’s son, Blaise Malley, 25, works for an Iran-sympathizing think tank, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, that has also basked in Soros’ largesse — even though founder Trita Parsi was found by a US court to have been credibly accused of acting as “an advocate for the regime” through his nonprofit National Iranian American Council after he brought a defamation suit charging this was false.

Since 2019, Soros has given Quincy — which says it advocates “restraint” in US foreign policy — $1.8 million, plus $100,000 to Parsi’s NIAC.

“NIAC and Quincy are the Russia Today of the Iranian Regime,” Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad wrote in 2022.

Soros’s cash has also indirectly flowed to Iran apologists via lefty groups like the Ploughshares Fund and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

In 2021, for example, when OSF gave Ploughshares $300,000, Ploughshares in turn showered $225,000 — $75,000 each — on the ICG, NIAC Action, and the Quincy Institute.

This year, Ploughshares awarded Vaez a direct grant for an unspecified amount.

OSF and Soros have funneled more than $15 million since 2016 to groups behind recent pro-Hamas protests in the US, The Post has reported.

“We value the donations we receive from across the political spectrum and have always been transparent about that support on our website,” said Jessica Rosenblum of the Quincy Institute.

“These groups are committed to promoting both international and regional peace and security,” said an OSF spokesperson. “None has ever worked on behalf of the government of the Islamic Republic.”

“I don’t know what either Soros’s vision is regarding Iran,” Noronha said. “But the things they routinely fund are things that weaken America, both internally and externally.”"

The 17th annual Bawcomville Redneck Christmas Parade was held on Dec. 2 in the small town of 2,700 residents in West Monroe, Louisiana.

“This is part of our town — I don’t think there’s very many rules,” parade participant Zach Raybourn told CNN.

Floats that participated in the holiday revelry were decorated in redneck themes and included one with a man sitting on a toilet bowl and others filled with empty beer cans.

Some displayed signs with ‘country’ sayings like “Kiss ur cuzin” and “Crack is wak” scrawled upon them.

A tractor, trash truck, and multiple pickup trucks were also part of the festivities.

“We have Leroy the Redneck Reindeer,” reveler Bryan Baker told the outlet, gesturing to a stuffed deer head with a red nose on his float. “You can’t get anymore redneck than that.”

Baker went on to explain how to define rednecks. “We’d rather be out in the woods, be out in the country — sit back on the porch, bonfire, cold beer,” he said.

Those who march toss items like toothbrushes, ramen noodles, beads, toilet paper, and candy into the crowd of spectators.

Shane Wooten, a local realtor, dressed as the Grinch and brought hundreds of packages of ramen noodles to throw from a La-Z-Boy he fastened to a motorized scooter.

The noodles are a nod to a joke about rednecks, that claims they eat dry noodles since they are cheaper than chips.

“It’s just not your typical Christmas parade. It’s something to laugh about,” Wooten told the outlet.

All proceeds from the event benefit local children during the Christmas season, according to the parade’s Facebook page.

“We have over 100 children and their families that we are trying to provide Christmas for this year! Everything stays right here in this community and truly does make a difference,” the post explained.

“I understand that most of us don’t have to worry about where our next meal will come from or where our children’s happiness will come from on Christmas morning, but that is not the case for a lot of families in our area.”

5 A tractor, trash truck, and multiple pickup trucks were also part of the festivities. CNN

More than 30% of residents in Bawcomville, which is close to 200 miles from Louisiana’s capital, Baton Rogue, live below the poverty line.

This is apparent on the parade route, which is lined with RVs and tents, where some residents live, abandoned stores, a pawn shop, and a few Dollar General stores.

Nonprofit workers Debi Mayo and Rachel Holmes from Bawcomville Hope, which provides hot meals to those in need there, were at the parade doing outreach.

“People don’t realize this is kind of like a Third World country,” Holmes told the outlet. There were many homeless people in the area, living in abandoned mobile homes.“

“And in the woods,” Mayo added. “Makeshift tents. It’s a terrible situation we’re in. Even people with jobs are suffering because of the high price of the economy.”"

The Friday fundraiser was held at the stately home of former U.S. ambassador to Spain James Costos and designer Michael Smith, whose guests were a who’s who of Democratic power players in the state, including Steven Spielberg, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

At nearby Holmby Park, where roughly 1,200-1,500 protesters chanted and jeered, parroting Hamas propaganda that Israel was committing “genocide” against Palestinians and denounced the Israel Defense Forces and the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Some carried giant likenesses of Biden with devil horns, and signs which read “End all U.S. aid to Israel,” “America, don’t let your tax $ fund killing babies.”

Police ultimately declared the event an unlawful assembly and cleared the protesters from the park.

Some cops later reported being hit with eggs and bottled water by the unruly crowd.

No arrests were reported.

Biden addressed his well-heeled audience for just 11 minutes.

He did not discuss Gaza and instead talked about his potentially looming rematch with former President Trump.

“Literally, I believe, the future of American democracy is at stake,” Biden said, CBSNews reported. “The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy, because if we lost that, we lose everything. We will be one of those generations that can say, ‘We saved democracy.'”

A second fundraiser is scheduled for Biden in Los Angeles Saturday evening and he is expected to return to Washington D.C. on Sunday."
118,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,"Biden flubs spending boast, invents new number in latest gaffe",https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/biden-flubs-spending-boast-invents-number-in-new-gaffe/,"President Biden appeared to invent a vast new number as he tried to boast about his administration’s massive infrastructure spending — a brain-twisting bungle that the White House sought to downplay in its official transcript.

“On my watch, instead of Infrastructure Week, America is having Infrastructure Decade,” the president told a crowd of union members in Las Vegas on Friday, in a speech touting federally funded railroad projects.

“Over a billion three hundred million trillion three hundred million dollars!” Biden exclaimed. “Trump just talks the talk, we walk the walk.”

The jab was meant as a swipe at Biden’s predecessor, former president Donald Trump, who did not pass such spending bills through Congress during his tenure — but it drew mockery online.

“Why does the President of the United States sound exactly like my 4-year-old when he’s trying to come up with the highest possible number?” wondered Biden critic Oren Ross on X.

On Saturday, nearly 18 hours later, the White House press office released a transcript that papered over the error by expressing it numerically, as “over 1,300,000,000 — $1,000,300,000,000” — hinting that the president had merely missed a few zeroes on his teleprompter, rather than dabbling in some new form of budgetary math.

The verbal stumble was the latest in a long string of Biden gaffes that have contributed to widespread voter worries about the 81-year-old president’s mental acuity and fitness for office.

In the same speech, Biden shared for at least the 13th time since taking office a debunked story involving a late Amtrak conductor who supposedly exclaimed “Joey, baby!” while extolling Biden’s lifetime rail ridership."

The weapons were found at a school compound in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shejaia Friday after Israel Defense Forces engaged in heavy fighting with a Hamas terrorist cell in the area, Israeli news reports said.

A video released by the IDF showed soldiers pulling the giant teddy from a pile of furniture and other items strewn across the classroom, laying it down, and slicing it open.

Hidden among the stuffing was the long rifle and a box of ammunition.

The school was used for terror purposes by Hamas, according to the IDF.

Soldiers found more weaponry hidden in classrooms at an adjacent school, in bags labeled “UNRWA.”

The initials stand for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which provides assistance and protection for Palestinian refugees, according to its website.

5 A sniper rifle and ammunition were found in a teddy bear during an IDF raid on a school compound in Gaza City as Israel continued its bombing campaign in the area, according to a report.

A search of the school compound where the teddy bear was found also revealed a tunnel shaft inside of a classroom, according to a report in the Jerusalem Post.

The tunnel discovery adds to the evidence that Hamas uses civilian areas, such as hospitals and shelters, as a cover for its terrorist activities, the report said.

Earlier this week, the IDF said it had found one of the largest Hamas stockpiles of weapons in the history of its operations in Gaza next to a school and a hospital.

5 The video shows soldiers pulling the giant teddy from a pile of furniture and other items strewn across the classroom, laying it down, and slicing it open.

The weapons cache contained hundreds of missiles and explosives, among other weapons, according to reports.

“Who stores RPG missiles, anti-tank missiles, explosive devices, long-range missiles, grenades, and UAVs at a school and a medical facility in Gaza?” the IDF asked in a post on X Wednesday. “The answer: Hamas. Hamas doesn’t hide their terrorism. Stop excusing it.”

Saturday, Israeli warplanes continued to strike parts of the Gaza Strip by land, sea, and air.

5 Hidden among the stuffing was the long rifle and a box of ammunition.

Its aerial bombing campaign pounded some of the areas in the territory’s south that it had told Palestinians to evacuate, according to reports.

The airstrikes came a day after the US vetoed a UN resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire.

The Security Council vote was 13-1, with the United Kingdom abstaining.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that Gaza was at “a breaking point” with its humanitarian support system on the verge of collapse, and some Arab countries expressed deep dissatisfaction with the US veto.

5 The school where the bear was found was used for terror purposes by Hamas, according to the IDF.

5 Israeli forces pull the rifle out of the large stuffed bear.

Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, who the US has touted as a possible post-war governing authority for Gaza, said that the veto was a “mark of shame that will follow the United States for many years.”

With the war entering its third month, the death toll in Gaza stands at more than 17,400, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.

120,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Families worry woke LA District Attorney George Gascon will prosecute suspected child molester as juvenile,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/families-worry-woke-la-da-george-gascon-will-prosecute-suspected-child-molester-as-juvenile/,"Rudy Paz is a 25-year-old Los Angeles man who prosecutors accuse of molesting children as young as 4 for years, but they don’t have any evidence of him continuing the abuse after his 18th birthday.

So, he might face juvenile punishment despite being an adult.

That’s what happened to Hannah Tubbs, a 26-year-old child molester and convicted killer whose light sentence sought under Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon’s direction didn’t include the requirement he register as a sex offender.

Paz’s victims had been “groomed” for years, according to an attorney for two of their families, Kathleen Cady, and they came forward only recently, leading to his arrest as an adult.

“Were this case in any other county, I’m sure it would already be up in adult criminal court,” Cady told Fox News Digital. “But in LA County, it’s not. We don’t know why. And we don’t know what the parameters are that they would be considering. It’s not anywhere to be found.”

After stirring outrage with his office’s handling of the Tubbs case, Gascon rescinded his blanket policy against transferring any juvenile cases to adult court and instead created a panel of handpicked allies, many of them former public defenders, to review certain high-profile cases and determine what to do, Cady said.

4 Hannah Tubbs, when she was booked as James Tubbs, in November 2021.

The catch with that is the panel operates outside public view and ignores state law that lists the criteria prosecutors and judges should consider when deciding whether to try a juvenile as an adult.

“His policies are an epic failure, but the bigger picture to me is how his policies lack transparency,” Cady said. “And so the public doesn’t really understand what they mean. And he does that, I think, deliberately, in an attempt to sort of hide what he’s actually doing.”

And there’s precedent for the victims’ fears. Hannah Tubbs, also known as James Tubbs, was sentenced Thursday for beating his friend to death with a rock in a fight over $100. Tubbs spent years in adult jails in multiple states when Los Angeles authorities arrested him in 2021 for the 2014 sex assault of a little girl in a Denny’s bathroom.

Because the crime happened weeks before Tubbs’ 18th birthday, Gascon’s office prosecuted him as a juvenile.

Once in Los Angeles custody, Tubbs began to identify as female, telling his father to call him “Hannah” in jailhouse phone calls in which he mocked his child victim and the lenient punishment he expected to face. With this new gender identity, the child molester, who targeted young girls, sought to be housed in a female juvenile jail.

A deputy district attorney who blew the whistle on Tubbs’ claims was suspended five days without pay for “misgendering” and “deadnaming” him despite evidence Tubbs’ new gender identity was a ruse.

Gascon’s office also played a role in the early release of Andrew Cachu, a convicted killer who served just six years of a 50-year prison sentence. Cachu walked free last year after the DA’s office declined to present evidence at a hearing to determine whether he should remain in custody after aging out of the juvenile detention facility when he turned 25, Fox News Digital reported at the time.

Only the most severe juvenile crimes are eligible to transfer to adult court, Cady said, including murder and child molestation.

“There are multiple counts, it went on for a long time, [but] originally, it would appear as though the DA’s office did not intend to even think about sending this up to adult criminal court,” Cady said of the Paz case. “And that has changed. Now, apparently they’re at least considering it.”

Gascon’s office told Fox News Digital a decision on whether to transfer the case to adult court had not been reached as of Thursday.

“A provisional transfer motion was filed in the juvenile court at the time the case was filed, pending a final decision on seeking transfer,” a spokesperson said. “LADA has established protocols for making appropriate determinations on seeking transfer, and the decision in this case is advancing through those protocols. A final decision on transfer is still pending.”

Paz is being held without bail. He’s due back in court Dec. 18."

The attorney’s method left some organizations thinking it was a scam, and they lost out on a slice of the unorthodox bequest.

Indianapolis resident Terry Kahn, a 30-year employee of the Veterans Administration, died in 2021 with no immediate family to leave his fortune to.

Kahn said in his will that it should be donated to “charity,” but failed to designate any particular organizations he supported.

Kahn’s attorney Dwayne Isaacs, told CBS News Kahn “was unbelievably frugal,” and didn’t even own a cell phone because he thought it was too expensive.

After his client died, Isaacs was tasked with the job of cold-calling dozens of local nonprofits and essentially offering them millions.

“Probably three or four different entities that lost out because they just didn’t take my call,” Isaacs told the outlet.

A nonprofit exec who took his call recalled hearing Isaacs’ shocking query.

“The first thing he said was, ‘What would you do with $1 million?'” recalled Emmy Hildebrand, CEO of Helping Veterans and Families of Indiana.

He was not alone in being stunned by the calls.

“It was an act of amazing kindness to which I responded, ‘I need to sit down,'” Sheehan said.

“We hovered above our own bodies, thinking, like, is this real?” another recipient, Julie Henson, vice president of development for Coburn Place, which supports domestic violence survivors, told the outlet.

According to Isaacs, Kahn lived in a modest house, drove an old Honda, and asked that when he passed no money be spent on a death announcement.

“He’s smiling someplace, there’s no doubt about it,” Isaacs told the outlet. “He would be getting a kick out of this.”"
122,[New York] https://nypost.com/news/,Donald Trump beats Joe Biden in new Wall Street Journal poll,https://nypost.com/2023/12/09/news/donald-trump-beats-joe-biden-in-new-wall-street-journal-poll/,"Former President Trump would beat President Biden if the 2024 election were held today, according to a new poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Biden trailed Trump 47% to 43% in the hypothetical match-up.

The lead widened from 37% to 31% when five potential third-party candidates were added to the mix.

The survey showed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley whipping Biden 51% to 34%, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis only managing a 45-45% draw with Biden.

Deep pessimism about Biden’s job performance drove the dour numbers.

Barely one in five Americans said Biden’s policies have helped them personally while a majority, 53%, said they were “hurt” by Biden’s presidency.

More than six out of 10 voters said they disapproved of President Biden’s job performance.

Just over five out of 10 voters said they also disapproved of Trump’s performance as president.

Two-thirds of voters said they believed the economy was poor or not good and that it had gotten worse in the last two years.

On major issues including the economy, crime, inflation, border security, and Israel-Hamas, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden.

The president received higher marks on abortion and “tone in politics.”

“We don’t have national elections, we have state elections. Trump is at 47%, which is about where he was in 2020. The question is can he get the extra 1.5% to be president,” said GOP consultant Ryan Girdusky — who warned that abortion could be a deadly issue.

“Abortion as an issue is a killer. Joe Biden is going to sit there and say Donald Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe V. Wade,” Girdusky said. “For a lot of women this is their big issue, for a lot of people this is their big issue. There is no way around that. “

Voters tended to see Trump as having more stamina than Biden and being more mentally up for the job.

Biden, 81, is the oldest president in American history.

More voters, however, said Biden was “honest” and “respects democracy.”

The poll was conducted by Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio and Democrat Michael Bocian.

Fabrizio is a longtime Trump pollster and currently works for a SuperPAC supporting the former president.

“If this race is about policy and performance, then Donald Trump has a significant advantage,” Fabrizio told the Journal. “If this race is about temperament and character, things like that, then Biden has an advantage.”

The poll also reconfirmed Trump’s dominance in the GOP presidential primary, where he has coasted far above his challengers throughout the year.

The survey found Trump leading his Republican rivals with 59% of GOP primary voters supporting him.

Haley and DeSantis battled it out for second place holding 15% and 14% support respectively.

Navalny, 47, is imprisoned in a penal colony east of Moscow and has been sentenced to a total of more 30 years on what he says are trumped-up charges to silence his criticism of President Vladimir Putin.

His aides said Navalny’s lawyers had stood all day outside the colony but been refused entry to see him, and he did not appear at scheduled judicial hearings about his case.

“We have learned that last week he had a serious health-related incident. Navalny’s life is at great risk. He is in complete isolation right now,” Maria Pevchikh, chair of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, posted on social media platform X.

Navalny’s spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said prison staff had put him on a drip last week after he suffered a dizzy spell and lay down on the floor of his cell in what she said looked like a “hunger faint.”

“Now it’s the third day that we don’t know where he is. Before that, there were at least occasional letters from him, albeit censored ones, but there have been no letters all week,” she wrote on X.

Navalny has long-term health issues, having survived being poisoned with a nerve agent in Siberia in 2020. The Kremlin denied trying to kill him and refuses to comment on his case, saying he is treated like any other prisoner."
124,[New Jersey] https://www.northjersey.com/news/,Flooding levels not likely to exceed moderate levels in North Jersey Sunday,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2023/12/10/storms-coming-sunday-into-monday/71870906007/,"Heavy flooding might not hit North Jersey overnight into Monday as was expected.

The heaviest rainfall area is expected to be east of North Jersey’s eastern counties, according to an update from the National Weather Service in Upton, NY in the 5 p.m. hour.

The service does warn if the front shifts west into the area, several rivers would reach minor flooding levels with a few reaching moderate levels.

Update on rain Sunday night

Now, the heaviest rainfall of 3-5 inches is expected to be east of the North Jersey area.

The NWS did state the ""potential exists for a few quick responding small rivers, streams, and creeks to exceed minor flood levels across Northeastern NJ and Westchester and Rockland Counties"" into Monday morning.

How much rain in North Jersey?

Most places in North Jersey can expect to get between 1 and 3 inches.

The area record for precipitation, on this date, is 1.6 inches (Newark, Dec. 10, 1969).

""We are expecting scattered flash flooding,"" said James Tomasini, meteorologist with the National Weather Service, earlier Sunday.

""Look out for any flash flood warnings, and don't try to drive through any flooded road,"" Tomasini said. ""We always say during a flood watch — and especially during a flood warning — don't drive unless you absolutely need to.""

A flood watch — there is one issued for all New Jersey counties and throughout the tristate area through 1 p.m. Monday — means that residents should be prepared for flooding, and keep an eye on weather alerts.

A warning means that anyone in a flood-prone area should immediately seek higher ground. You can get the latest information at weather.gov/nyc. Or else stay tuned to local radio and TV stations.

""We monitor the radar, and we'd put out a warning,"" Tomasini said.

Wind gusts in North Jersey

Winds, meanwhile, could reach up to 45 mph in coastal New Jersey areas, and 40 mph inland. There could be scattered power outages.

The worst of the storm, Tomasini said, will likely be over around 7 a.m. Monday in most places. ""But there could be some lingering area flooding,"" he said.

A wind advisory, issued at 3:20 a.m. and due to expire at 1 p.m. Monday, affects the coastal Atlantic, coastal Ocean, Cape May and eastern Monmouth counties.

Locally Sunday afternoon, rain and possibly a thunderstorm are expected after 1 p.m., with light and variable south winds of 15 to 20 mph in Bergen County, 11 to 16 mph in Passaic County. Between half and three quarters of an inch of rain are possible. Temperatures are expected to reach a high near 59.

On Monday, there is a 40 percent chance of rain before 10 a.m. Clouds will start to clear late morning, with a high near 44, and a breezy west wind of 18 to 24 mph, with gusts as high as 37.

A coastal flood advisory was issued at 5:26 a.m. Sunday and is set to expire 10 a.m. Monday.

During the night, the temperatures are expected to drop to around 40 in Bergen County, 38 in Passaic, with a north wind of 13 to 16 mph after midnight, and gusts as high as 28 mph. Between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall is possible.

Storm watch in NJ

A flood watch, in effect since 3:47 am and set to end 11 a.m. Sunday, affects eastern and western Bergen, eastern and western Passaic, eastern and western Essex, eastern and western Union, Hudson, Morris, Somerset, Sussex, Warren, eastern and western Monmouth, Middlesex, Mercer, Hunterdon, Ocean, Cumberland, Atlantic, Salem, Gloucester, northwestern and southeastern Burlington, Camden, and Cape May counties.

Predictions for Eastern Seaboard

The front, extending from Eastern Canada to the Eastern Gulf coast, will bring varying problems to many parts of the country.

Snow is forecast over some higher elevations in New York State and Northern New England.

There is a small chance that some of the thunderstorms that could develop overnight in the southern Mid-Atlantic and the Eastern Gulf Coast might be severe, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s storm prediction center in Norman, OK. There could be possible wind gusts, tornadoes, and — more unlikely — hail.

126,[North Carolina] https://carolinapublicpress.org/recent-news/,Habitat in Virginia turns to 3D printing. Would it work in NC?,https://carolinapublicpress.org/62458/habitat-for-humanity-3d-printing-charlotte-nc/,"By Lexi Wilson, WCNC Charlotte

CHARLOTTE — During the 2023 Local News Impact Summit, presented by the Charlotte Journalism Collaborative, housing advocates, community leaders, nonprofit organizations and local journalists focused on current trends in affordable housing and the potential solutions that exist.

During the summit, Charlotte’s affordable housing leaders posed the question, can Charlotte use 3D printing?

These days, the technology behind 3D printing is being tapped to create more affordable housing.

In 2021, a Virginia family got the keys to Habitat for Humanity’s first 3D-printed home in the nation, and now they’re building two more.

Their goal is to use the technology to make building quicker and cheaper.

“If we can build faster, we can create more affordable housing for these families with low to moderate income,” Janet V. Green, CEO of Habitat for Humanity Peninsula and Greater Williamsburg in Virginia, said.

The 3D printer looks like a giant robot. It builds the wall system of a home with a concrete mixture. Traditional construction is used for other things like the roof, wiring, and plumbing.

Green said printing the walls is faster than wood framing.

“We think this reduced our standard construction schedule by at least four weeks using this innovative technology,” Green said.

WCNC Charlotte’s Lexi Wilson went to Bob Glusenkamp, senior VP of construction operations for Habitat for Humanity of the Charlotte Region, to see whether this could be a solution to adding more affordable housing in Charlotte.

“One of the big challenges is that not all of the code officials have been exposed to it yet, so it’s not really in our North Carolina building code,” Glusenkamp said.

He said like any new building material or building technology, people in the industry have to get used to it and right now, it’s still new — and printers of this size are few and far between. But there’s hope one day, 3D printing will become mainstream in Charlotte.

“I think it will be part of the future of all Habitat affiliates in the U.S., it just needs to get more affordable and produce at a large enough scale that we can all use it,” Glusenkamp said.

Right now, there is also a labor shortage of construction workers. Green said adding 3D printing as another tool for creating housing opens the door for the next generation to get involved in construction.

“I like to say my grandson has no desire to work in the construction industry but he’s good with technology, so he was very interested in this,” Green said. “So we are hoping this gets people more involved in the labor force of how to build homes differently.”

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Last week, a Republican-led House committee summoned the leaders of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT to Capitol Hill for a scalding critique of their efforts to address antisemitism on their campuses since the eruption of the Israel-Gaza war.





During the hearing, Penn’s president Liz Magill – and the other university presidents – declined to state plainly that a call for genocide against Jews would violate the university’s code of conduct.





Magill told Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) it would violate the school’s code of conduct “if the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.” When pressed by Stefanik, Magill said: “It is a context-dependent decision, congresswoman.”





Then, over the weekend, Magill resigned.

129,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"In Hong Kong, ‘patriots-only’ local elections see record-low voter turnout",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/in-hong-kong-patriots-only-local-elections-see-rec/,"Hong Kong saw a record-low voter turnout for Sunday’s ​closely watched District Council elections, after a process that saw only those with “patriotic” credentials allowed to​ run for office.

According to the Hong Kong elections website, voter turnout was ​just 27.5​%. That contrasts with a 71.2​% turnout in the last district elections in 2019, according to the Hong Kong Free Press, a Hong Kong-based ​activist news website.

​It was the first District Council elections held after the Beijing government passed a stringent new security law for the onetime British colony, an attempt to rein in Hong Kong’s boisterous tradition of local democracy and the enclave’s rising resistance to control from the ruling Communist Party. A ​new requirement that candidates secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees before being allowed to join the race led to a clean-sweep for pro-Beijing candidates Sunday.

The low turnout came despite significant efforts​ by authorities — including carnivals and free concerts — to encourage voters to go to the polls. A glitch in the electronic voting systems also​ led to the polls being opened an hour later than had been planned.​ Six arrests were reported.

The district councils, ​whose jurisdiction includes local issues such as building projects and approving public facilities, are Hong Kong’s last major political bodies mostly chosen by the public.

​Watershed

Pro-democracy forces saw the turnout and the result as a watershed moment for Hong Kong. In 2019, ​the city was shaken by massive, disruptive and sometimes violent demonstrations opposing the extradition of ​local residents to face trials in ​mainland China​, seen as a direct challenge to Hong Kong’s long-independent local institutions.

The protests empowered pro-democracy groups and activists​, and that year’s District Council vote saw 17 out of 18 districts​ captured by pro-democracy candidates.

Beijing reacted. In 2020, the passage of a powerful “National Security Law” significantly chilled Hong Kong’s political climate. Changes to electoral districts and processes followed.

​Some 88 seats out of a total of 470 in the District Council were up for grabs in Sunday’s direct election, with ​4.3 million voters able to cast ballots. The number of directly elected council seats was a cut of 20​% from the 2019 election.

Electoral boundaries had also been redrawn. Those seats that are not occupied as a result of direct vote are chosen by the city’s ​Beijing-friendly chief executive and government committees. ​There were significant vacancies as well: A large number of district councilors who declined to take a new oath of allegiance resigned from their seats in 2021.

With all the newly filled seats occupied by pro-Beijing candidates, ​the central government pronounced itself satisfied with Sunday’s results.

A spokesperson for the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region called ​the results “a fair, just, open and high-quality election with wide participation of the society,” the​ Chinese Communist Party-controlled People’s Daily reported.

The ​liaison ​office is the de facto representative of Beijing in Hong Kong, ​which, since handover ​from Britain to China in 1997, has been run as a Special Administrative Region, or SAR.

The spokesperson added that “this election has completely excluded anti-China rioters from the​ … governance system, effectively implemented the principle of ‘patriots administering Hong Kong,’ and opened a new chapter in district governance.”

Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive John Lee ​told the Xinhua News Agency that the new councilors will be “patriots administering Hong Kong​,” ensuring that the entire governance system complies with ​principle of “one country, two systems​.”

​But some said there was no way to sugarcoat the plunge in voter enthusiasm reflected in the low turnout numbers.

“The record low turnout must be hugely humiliating for the government and its allies given the unprecedented propaganda campaigns and ubiquitous mobilization,” Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, told The Associated Press.

​Party-centric ‘patriotism’

Chinese President Xi Jinping​ has embarked on a campaign to promote “patriotism​” across the land, with a law on ​patriotic ​education being enacted in October this year.

​But some academics see the push by the powerful Chinese leader as party-centric nationalism​ by another name, designed more to cement the regime’s hold on power than to teach ordinary Chinese about their country’s past.

At a time when China is expanding ​economically and militarily around the region and the world, a key aim of patriotic education has been to remind the Chinese of the humiliations their country suffered at the hands of colonial powers in the 19th and 20th centuries.​ Foremost among them was Britain, which won Hong Kong as a colony after victory in the ​one-sided First Opium War in 1842.

After the U.K.’s historic lease expired, it handed the colony — by then an Asian powerhouse that was home to vibrant financial, service and movie industries — back to China amid great fanfare in 1997.

​Hong Kong has since been ruled under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle that recognizes the differences between ​the city and the mainland. But the watershed year of 2019, and multiple events since, have cast doubts among many Hong Kongers and outsider observers about Beijing‘s commitment to the principle.

Mr. Lee was the only candidate approved by Beijing for Hong Kong’s chief executive position in 2022. A former policeman and security official, he greenlighted the arrest of scores of pro-democracy figures in 2021.

​The fallout from Sunday’s vote and the shrinking sphere for civil liberties in Hong Kong could have some aftershocks.

The events in Hong Kong ​are being closely followed in Taiwan. ​With relations with China dominating the campaign, the democratic island goes to the polls in January to vote for a new president.

130,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Allies of imprisoned Kremlin foe Navalny sound the alarm, say they haven’t heard from him in 6 days",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/allies-of-imprisoned-alexei-navalny-sound-alarm-sa/,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Allies of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny sounded the alarm on Monday, saying that neither they nor the politician’s lawyers have heard from him in six days.

Navalny, who is serving a 19-year term on charges of extremism, was due to appear in court Monday via video link but didn’t, spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said. She said prison officials cited electricity problems. Lawyers in recent days also haven’t been able to access Navalny, according to Yarmysh.

“It is already the sixth straight day that we don’t know where Alexei is and what is happening to him,” Yarmysh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Navalny, 47, has been behind bars since January 2021. As President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, he campaigned against official corruption and organized major anti-Kremlin protests. His arrest came upon his return to Moscow from Germany, where he recuperated from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.

Navalny has since been handed three prison terms and spent months in isolation in a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow for alleged minor infractions. He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated.

Last week, Yarmysh said that for three days in a row Navalny‘s lawyers spent hours at the penal colony waiting for permission to visit him, only to be turned away at the last minute. Letters to the politician were not being delivered, and he didn’t appear at scheduled court hearings via video link.

Yarmysh said Friday that the developments were concerning given that Navalny recently fell ill: “He felt dizzy and lay down on the floor. Prison officials rushed to him, unfolded the bed, put Alexei on it and gave him an IV drip. We don’t know what caused it, but given that he’s being deprived of food, kept in a cell without ventilation and has been offered minimal outdoor time, it looks like fainting out of hunger.”

She added that lawyers visited him after the incident and he looked “more or less fine.”

Navalny is due to be transferred to a “special security” penal colony, a facility with the highest security level in the Russian penitentiary system.

Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited or unavailable."

“They destroyed the Gaza Strip. There is no opportunity to live,” Yousef al-Mansi said during questioning by Israel‘s Shin Bet security agency.

As Israel continues its campaign to destroy Hamas, Mr. al-Mansi said Yahya Sinwar, the group’s current leader, has lost the support of those living in the Palestinian enclave. Israeli Defense Forces officials believe Sinwar was the mastermind behind the attack that resulted in the death of more than 1,200 people and about 240 others taken hostage.

“I have not seen anyone in the Gaza Strip who supports Sinwar. Nobody likes Sinwar,” Mr. al-Mansi told his Israeli interrogators, according to the Times of Israel. “There are people who, day and night, pray that God will free us from him.”

Israeli security officials released a 14-minute video of the interrogation that was conducted Sunday. They did not release further details about Mr. al-Mansi‘s detention, the Times of Israel reported.

“People in the Gaza Strip say that Sinwar and his group destroyed us. We must get rid of them,” Mr. al-Mansi said.

132,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Dutch official says Geert Wilders and 3 other party leaders should discuss forming a new coalition,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/dutch-official-says-geert-wilders-and-3-other-part/,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The far-right party led by Dutch election winner Geert Wilders should open negotiations with three other parties on forming a new government, the official appointed to investigate possible coalitions said Monday.

Ronald Plasterk, who acted as the “scout” in two weeks of preliminary talks, said it was “too early” to say how long it might take to form a new government amid significant policy differences between some of the parties.

Wilders’ Party for Freedom won 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of the Dutch parliament in the Nov. 22 election, making it the biggest party and putting the veteran anti-Islam lawmaker in pole position to form the next ruling coalition.

Plasterk said that Wilders should hold coalition talks with New Social Contract, a reformist party formed over the summer that won 20 seats, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, which was led by outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and the Farmer Citizen Movement, or BBB.

Together, the four parties have 88 seats — a comfortable majority in the lower house. However, the four parties don’t have a majority in the Dutch Senate.

Coalition talks will be tricky as the parties have significant ideological differences to bridge if they are to form the next Cabinet. Wilders is likely to have to convince potential partners that he will shelve some of his controversial policies — including his call for a ban on mosques, Islamic schools and the Quran — which breach the freedom of religion that is enshrined in the Dutch Constitution.

Plasterk’s report acknowledged the issue and said that the first stage of the coalition talks should be to investigate if the leaders can agree “on a common baseline for guaranteeing the constitution, fundamental rights and the democratic rule of law.”

The aim of the initial round of negotiations that should be completed by the end of January is to “establish if there is a basis for a next round (of talks) about a form of political cooperation that would form the foundation of a stable Cabinet,” Plasterk said in his report.

That could be a minority administration without the VVD. The party’s new leader, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, said shortly after the election that she wouldn’t join a coalition led by Wilders, but would be prepared to support it from parliament.

Plasterk said that if the leaders can agree on the constitutional issues, then they should move on to discuss whether there is “a real perspective” for cooperation on key election issues, including migration, good governance, foreign policy, climate, pollution and agriculture.

Plasterk held several days of talks with political leaders before writing his report. The recently installed lower house of parliament will debate his findings on Wednesday and will then likely appoint an “informer” to lead the coalition talks over the next two months and report back to parliament by early February.

Coalition talks after the last Dutch general election were the longest-ever in the Netherlands at nearly nine months."
133,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Russia attacks Kyiv with ballistic missiles, but Ukraine says it intercepted all of them",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/russia-attacks-kyiv-with-ballistic-missiles-but-uk/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia fired eight ballistic missiles at Kyiv early Monday, all of which were shot down, Ukraine’s Air Force said. The thwarted attack still left one person injured by shrapnel and three more suffered severe stress reactions, officials said.

A series of loud explosions rang out in Ukraine‘s capital just after 4 a.m., as the city was under its nightly curfew, followed by air raid sirens.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that in the Darnytskyi district of eastern Kyiv the debris of an intercepted missile fell without catching fire, and elsewhere in the capital the explosive wave damaged the windows of a house.

The attack also left 120 households in the city without electricity, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said. Last winter Russian troops were deliberately targeting the Ukrainian energy system causing power outages and blackouts across the country.

Over the weekend the U.K. defense ministry noted that Russia last week used its heavy bomber fleet for the first time since September. It predicted the start of a more concerted campaign aimed at degrading Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter sets in.

Kyiv is routinely targeted by Russian drone and missile attacks.

Just over two weeks ago, Kyiv came under what Ukrainian officials said was the most intense drone attack since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 75 Iranian-made Shahed drones against the capital, of which 74 were destroyed by air defenses.

Monday’s attack on the capital happened as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Argentina, where he attended the swearing-in of the country’s new president, Javier Milei. It was the Ukrainian leader’s first official trip to Latin America as Kyiv continues to court support among developing nations for its 21-month-old fight against Russia’s invading forces.

Zelenskyy met with Milei as well as with the presidents of Uruguay, Paraguay and Ecuador. During the inauguration ceremony, Zelenskyy could be seen exchanging words with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, widely considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies in Europe and one of the few European leaders who hasn’t sided with Ukraine in the war.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said he had a “highly straightforward conversation” with Orban, “focused on our European affairs.”

He said he also spoke by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen “about joint work at the EU level and about the joint defense of Europe.”

EU leaders are meeting later this week in Brussels. Orban has demanded that EU membership talks with Ukraine and billions of euros in funding meant for Kyiv be taken off the agenda.

Zelenskyy was due to travel to Washington for meetings Tuesday with President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials.

“Volodymyr Zelenskyy will focus on ensuring unity among the United States, Europe and the world in supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian terror and strengthening the international order based on rules and respect for the sovereignty of each nation,” his office said in a statement.

Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion ($61.4 billion) package of wartime funding for Ukraine and Israel, along with other national security priorities. But the request is caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security.

Elsewhere in Ukraine on Monday, Russia fired 18 drones overnight, and the Air Force intercepted all of them, mostly over the southern Mykolaiv region."
134,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Mountain view: North Korea urges pilgrimages to peak linked to Kim ‘heroism’,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/10/mountain-view-north-korea-urges-pilgrimages-to-pea/,"North Korean state media is encouraging citizens to undertake winter climbs of Mount Baekdu, a peak venerated by Koreans ancient and modern, North and South.

The official Rodong Shinmun newspaper noted approvingly late last week that thousands of groups have followed leader Kim Jong-un‘s example and ascended the mountain. It urged others to do so to refresh their “revolutionary spirit.”

The deliberate association of a myth-laden mountain with newer myths of the Kims has emerged as a core element of the powerful personality cult buttressing the family that has ruled North Korea for three generations, Pyongyang watchers say.

A merger of propaganda from the 1970s and 1980s with East Asian traditions of sacred mountains has generated the legend of a “Mount Baekdu bloodline” that supposedly runs through the veins of Mr. Kim, his ancestors and a rising generation coming to prominence.

The current North Korean dictator, having succeeded his father and grandfather in the post, has often been photographed in the area. Most famously, he was shown in 2019, outfitted in bespoke riding gear and mounted upon a white steed on Baekdu’s snow-covered trails.

The images of an obese individual in a nation wracked by malnutrition striking heroic poses generated guffaws across English-language social media, but to North Koreans, it was no joke.

Living in a shuttered state without freedom of movement, information, association or expression, something close to religious fervor surrounds the Kims, and Mount Baekdu is a key pilgrimage site.

Mighty mountain, heroic Kim

The mountain, which straddles North Korea’s border with China – where it is known as Changbai - is actually an extinct volcano. Complete with a scenic lake in its crater that was legendarily inhabited by a water dragon, the 9.003-foot Mt. Baekdu is the Korean peninsula’s highest point.

East Asians have long venerated mountains. Japan has Mount Fuji. Chinese sages and emperors were associated with certain peaks, said academic and tour guide David Mason, and an official system of mountains, complete with shrines and pilgrimage sites, was established.

Ancient Koreans embraced the concept as well.

“Mountains were very much used in the founding myths of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties,” said Mr. Mason, who specializes in sacred Korean peaks. The mythological first Korean, Dangun, was supposedly born on the mountain.

“It has often been remarked how North Korea is un-Communist and anti-Marxist because it turned to a traditional, mountain-based bloodline royalty,” Mr. Mason said.

Though a powerful personality cult surrounded Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, he did not create a dynasty.

Kim Il Sung – who was installed in Pyongyang under Soviet auspices — was more successful: His son and grandson went on to hold apparently undisputed power in North Korea, a grip that has lasted to this day.

Born in 1912, Kim Il Sung was a Korean communist and guerilla leader who spent three decades in exile before returning home when Soviet Union forces invaded Manchuria and northern Korea in 1945 at the very end of World War II.

His personality cult went into overdrive after the disastrous Korean War that he had initiated.

In the 1970s and 1980s, state propaganda linked Mr. Kim to Mount Baekdu. It claimed he established a secret guerilla headquarters on the forested slopes, siring his son there between battles with the Japanese.

“This a pure, 100% propaganda fantasy: Such a camp never existed,” said Andrei Lankov, a South Korea-based Russian specialist in Korean studies who previously studied in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung University. “But the myth of Mount Baekdu is extremely important for North Korean nation-building and the essential ‘Koreanness’ of the Kim family.”

Working behind the scenes in Pyongyang media in the 1970s and ‘80s, Kim Il Sung’s Russian-born son, named Yuri at birth, took the Korean name Kim Jong-il.

“He was a big influence on his father’s personality cult though he was smart enough not to promote himself,” said Michael Breen, a biographer of Kim Jong-il. “Therein lay his own legitimacy.”

Kim Jong-il took power after his father died in 1994, the first-ever dynastic succession in a supposedly Communist state. He was succeeded by his own son, Kim Jong-un, after his death in 2011.

Further broadening the Kim dynastic footprint is Kim Jong-un‘s sister, Kim Yo Jong. A high-ranking party functionary and state media columnist, some credit her with boosting her brother’s public image by linking it more closely to that of his esteemed grandfather.

Official statues and paintings depict the latter on horseback, while a famous poster of Kim Jong-il shows him standing on Mount Baekdu.

Mountain landscapes, sacred landscapes

A diplomat with experience in Pyongyang said that the average North Korean takes the “Baekdu bloodline” seriously. South of the DMZ, few South Koreans admire the Kims, but Mount Baekdu is famed there, too.

It is mentioned in the first line of South Korea’s national anthem, and its crater lake is a hugely popular image on paintings, posters and calendars. Despite its border location, young South Koreans in Seoul say that they are taught in school that the mountain is Korean, not Chinese.

It was no coincidence that a trip up Mount Baekdu, by cable car, was the highlight of a visit by then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in with Mr. Kim in 2018 when inter-Koreans relations were – briefly – rosy.

Currently, Mr. Kim appears to be expanding his family’s media presence. He has made multiple appearances with his daughter Ju Ae. His wife, Ri Sol Ju, has been pictured with him at a wintry Mount Baekdu.

In an officially agnostic state, the linkages forged between an iconic mountain, a heroicized ruling clan and North Korea itself are no joke, experts said.

“People from different religions take pilgrimages to their holy lands – be it Islam, Christianity or ‘Kimism,’” said Steve Tharp, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who formerly undertook negotiations with North Korean officers.

“Though we live in an age when we are encouraged to respect others’ religions and cultures, I don’t think we should respect North Korea’s, as that state is not admirable,” added Mr. Breen. “But I don’t think we should dismiss it either, as it is sort of a symbol of the sacred — it is a deep place.”

135,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Prospects for new cease-fire dim as Israel presses campaign in southern Gaza,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/10/prospects-for-new-cease-fire-dim-as-israel-presses/,"The nation that helped broker a string of prisoner-for-hostages swaps between Israel and Hamas militants warned Sunday that the window for future deals may be closing as Israeli forces intensify attacks in southern Gaza.

The exchanges, carried out during a weeklong cease-fire in the Palestinian enclave, briefly raised hopes of a longer break in the fighting and increased assistance for besieged Gaza residents caught up in the fighting.

But Israel, backed by the Biden administration, has argued that a lengthy cease-fire would only give Hamas leaders, whose Oct. 7 murderous rampage into southern Israel ignited the latest round of fighting, time to regroup and re-arm.

Officials in Qatar, which played a key mediating role in the first cease-fire, said Sunday the resumption of fierce fighting in the northern and southern parts of Gaza has made future diplomatic efforts much more difficult.

“What happened in the fallout of this pause, actually we feel disappointment that the parties didn’t give a chance for further efforts to be taking place,” Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman, who is also the oil-rich country’s foreign minister, told a forum in Doha Sunday, adding his government “is not going to give up” on its efforts in Gaza.

“It always takes two parties to be willing to [agree to] such an engagement,” Mr. al-Thani said. “Unfortunately we are not seeing the same willingness that we have seen in the weeks before in … both parties.

SEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders defies liberal calls for Israel-Hamas cease-fire

Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi told a television interviewer Sunday that there was no deadline to end the war while Hamas remains intact and more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals remain hostages.

“The evaluation that this can’t be measured in weeks is correct, and I’m not sure it can be measured in months,” he said.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, appearing Sunday on “CNN,” again tried to walk a messaging tightrope for the administration, repeatedly backing Israel‘s right to defend itself and punish Hamas while pleading for greater protections for Gaza civilians.

Gaza health officials say the number of total Palestinian deaths in the Israeli operation after Oct. 7 has now topped 17,700, and reports of heavy civilian deaths have sparked fury across the Arab world and growing international pressure for Israel to pull back. The Palestinian estimates cannot be confirmed from outside sources.

Some 1,200 people were killed and around 240 soldiers and civilians were taken hostage in the initial Hamas surprise attack.

“Israel needs to be able to deal with this to protect itself, to prevent Oct. 7 from happening again,” Mr. Blinken said. “But, as it does that, it’s imperative that civilians be protected.”

While Mr. Blinken said there are constant talks between the U.S. and Israel, questions on how to conduct the war and how long the fighting will last are “decisions for Israel to make.”

Israeli officials argue that Hamas, which Israel, the U.S. and many Western nations consider to be a terrorist organization, is to blame for locating many of its military outposts in heavily civilian areas.

But the pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was evident Friday, when the U.S. was forced to use its veto to block an emergency U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the conflict. The vote in the council was 13-1, with only Britain abstaining.

Having already moved into the northern end of the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces were reportedly pushing their way Sunday into the center of Khan Younis, the biggest city in southern Gaza and a place where many refugees from the fighting in the north had taken shelter.

With fighting now underway throughout Gaza and the borders sealed against fleeing abroad, aid groups said the 2.3 million residents of Gaza face an increasingly impossible choice when seeking refuge.

Mr. Blinken, speaking separately on ABC’s “This Week,” defended a new Pentagon arms package for Israel, including a portion that bypassed the regular congressional approval process on an emergency basis.

“We want to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Hamas,” Mr. Blinken said.

“A small portion of what has been requested is going through on an emergency basis that is moving quickly so that Israel can have what it needs in hand. But virtually everything else is going through the regular order, through Congress.”

Again noting the heavy civilian toll of the Gaza fighting, Mr. Blinken added, “When it comes to the weapons that we transfer, the rules that go along with them, those rules apply to Israel as they do to any other country, including the way they’re used and the need, the imperative of respecting international humanitarian law.”

136,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Israel fights militants in Gaza’s main cities, with civilians still trapped in the crossfire",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/israel-fights-militants-in-gazas-main-cities-with-/,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants in Gaza‘s two largest cities on Monday, with civilians still trapped in the fighting even after hundreds of thousands have fled to other parts of the besieged territory.

Israel has pledged to keep fighting until it removes Hamas from power, dismantles its military capabilities and returns all of the hostages taken by militants during Hamas‘ Oct. 7 surprise attack into Israel that ignited the war.

The U.S. has provided unwavering diplomatic and military support for the campaign, even as it has urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties and further mass displacement. The war has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and driven nearly 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes.

Residents said there was heavy fighting in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli ground forces opened a new line of attack last week, and battles were still underway in parts of Gaza City and the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, where large areas have been reduced to rubble.

Radwa Abu Frayeh saw heavy Israeli strikes around the European Hospital in Khan Younis, where the U.N. humanitarian office says tens of thousands of people have sought shelter. She said a strike hit a home close to hers late Sunday.

“The building shook,” she said. “We thought it was the end and we would die.”

Hussein al-Sayyed, who fled Gaza City earlier in the war with his three daughters, is staying in a three-story home in the city with around 70 others, and said they have been rationing food for days.

“Over many days, I have eaten just one meal a day to save food for the girls. They are still young,” he said. “I don’t know where to go. No place is safe.”

Hamas is believed to have suffered heavy losses, but on Monday it fired a barrage of rockets that set off sirens in Tel Aviv. One person was lightly wounded, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service, and Channel 12 broadcast footage of a cratered road and damage to cars and buildings in a suburb.

With very little aid allowed into Gaza, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods. Some openly worry that Palestinians will be forced out of the territory altogether in a repeat of the mass exodus from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.

“Expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a forum in Qatar on Sunday.

Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, called allegations that Israeli intends to drive people en masse from Gaza “outrageous and false.” But other Israeli officials have discussed such a scenario, raising alarm in Egypt and other Arab countries that refuse to accept any refugees.

At the same time, it’s not clear when or if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza City and much of the north - home to some 1.2 million before the war - where entire neighborhoods have been flattened.

Palestinians in Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied West Bank observed a general strike on Monday called by activists to demand a cease-fire, after the U.S. vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for one on Friday. A similar, nonbinding vote is planned in the General Assembly on Tuesday.

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, saying it endangers residents by fighting in dense areas and positioning military infrastructure - including weapons, tunnels and rocket launchers - in or near civilian buildings.

The military said five soldiers were killed in a battle in southern Gaza on Sunday, after militants fired at them from a school and set off an explosive device. It said the troops, backed by aircraft and tanks, returned fire and killed the militants.

Forces operating in Jabaliya found a truck full of long-range rockets near a school, and a rifle, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and explosives in a home, the army said.

Israel has urged people to flee to what it says are safe areas in the south - and the fighting in and around Khan Younis has pushed tens of thousands toward the town of Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt. But Israel has continued to strike alleged militant targets throughout the territory. Associated Press reporters saw nine bodies brought to a local hospital on Monday after an airstrike hit a home in Rafah overnight.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said people in the south are also falling ill as they pack into crowded shelters or sleep in tents in open areas.

Nicholas Papachrysostomou, MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, said “every other patient” at a clinic in Rafah has a respiratory infection after prolonged exposure to cold and rain.

“In some shelters, 600 people share a single toilet. We are already seeing many cases of diarrhea. Often children are the worst affected,” he said.

With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,900, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Some 1,300 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed during the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas and other militants also captured more than 240 people, including babies, women and older adults. More than 100 captives were released during a weeklong cease-fire late last month in exchanges for women and minors held in Israeli prisons.

Israel says Hamas still has 117 hostages and the remains of 20 people who died in captivity or during the initial attack. The Israeli toll includes 104 soldiers who have died since the start of the Gaza ground offensive in late October.

137,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Thousands of demonstrators from Europe expected in Brussels to protest austerity measures in the EU,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/thousands-of-demonstrators-from-europe-expected-in/,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Thousands of protesters are expected to gather in Brussels on Tuesday to protest what they perceive as new austerity measures as the 27 European Union countries discuss ways to overhaul rules on government spending.

Finance ministers from the bloc have been negotiating for months a reform of the EU‘s rules limiting debt and deficits for member states, known as the Stability and Growth Pact, which would curtail the options of nations seeking to spend their way out of a crisis and potentially force them into austerity. The rulebook, which has often proved difficult to enforce and has served as a source of tension, was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic but should be reactivated next year.

Current rules stipulate that member states’ total public debt must not exceed 60% of their GDP, and their annual deficit must be kept below 3%.

According to the EU latest figures, the highest rates of government debt to GDP were in Greece with 166.5%, Italy with 142.4%, with four other nations also breaking the 100%, mark.

Amid tensions between Germany and France, an agreement on the revised rules has yet to be found.

But the European Trade Union Confederation, which represents 45 million members, claims that under the current draft proposal for a reform, 14 member states will be forced to cut a combined 45 billion euros from their budgets next year alone.

“Under the current proposal, member states with a deficit above 3% of GDP will have to reduce their budget deficit by a minimum of 0.5% of GDP every year,” the ETUC said. “That would lead to fewer jobs, lower wages, stretched public services and leave most EU member states unable to make the investments needed to meet the EU’s own social and climate targets.”

With next year’s European elections looming and a rise of the far-right across the continent, the ETUC also warned that “the far-right is the main beneficiary of the type of fiscal policies being proposed.”

It said unions will use the protest in the capital city of the EU‘s institutions to call for measures excluding investments for social and climate targets from spending limits.

They will also ask governments to keep in place solidarity mechanism introduced during the coronavirus crisis such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility multibillion euro plan of loans and grants devised to help the EU’s 27 countries breathe new life into their virus-ravaged economies."
138,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,McConnell says border security ‘not a sideshow’ as Schumer blames GOP for failed Ukraine funding,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/mcconnell-says-border-security-not-sideshow-as-sch/,"Senate leaders remained at an impasse Monday over proposals to secure the U.S. southern border, despite continued negotiations on ending the logjam over a national security spending package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.

The stalemate comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet Tuesday with leaders in Washington, marking his most consequential visit as Congress struggles to pass more war aid.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused President Biden and Democrats in Congress of wearing blinders when it comes to fixing the record flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.

“When it comes to keeping America safe, border security is not a sideshow. It’s ground zero,” the Kentucky Republican said in a floor speech. “Senate Republicans have no more spare time to explain this basic reality. We cannot convince anyone who doesn’t want to acknowledge the glaring facts on the ground. The Senate has to act.”

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer pointed the finger at Republicans for “insisting on Donald Trump’s border policies.”

“They will be at fault when a deal for Ukraine, Israel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza all fall apart,” the New York Democrat said. “Republicans would be giving Vladimir Putin the best gift he could ask for.”

Mr. Zelenskyy will have an all-senators meeting Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill, followed by a one-on-one session with House Speaker Mike Johnson. He will also meet with Mr. Biden at the White House.

Mr. Biden’s national security package failed in the Senate last week when it was blocked by Republicans. It would provide $110 billion that included roughly $60 billion for Ukraine.

The U.S. has already approved $111 billion for Ukraine, money that will run dry by year’s end. But Congress is likely to punt any decision on additional money into next year as lawmakers head home for the holidays later this week.

Republicans’ insistence for the inclusion of border security policies, coupled with Democrats’ refusal to address a problem that U.S. officials say jeopardizes national security, has created a weeks-long standoff.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young urged Senate negotiators to quickly reach a resolution, but charged Republicans with asking for too much on border control.

“You can’t have everything your way in a negotiation. Democrats and Republicans have to vote for this bill,” Ms. Young said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation. “I agree, it’s time to cut a deal that both sides can agree to.”

Republicans’ latest proposal included several Trump-era border policies and changes to the asylum and parole processes that they say would slash the amount of illegal crossings and keep migrants out of the country while waiting for their day in immigration court.

The offer included shutting down the border if crossings reach a certain threshold, reviving the so-called Title 42 pandemic policy to quickly turn back migrants before they cross, limit parole authority and require ankle monitoring for those who are allowed to leave detention centers, and an expedited removal authority that Mr. Biden rescinded.

The Republican-controlled House passed a standalone aid bill for Israel last month, which Senate leaders have dismissed over their preference for a broader package. Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, is open to such legislation but warned there are hurdles among his conservative members over Ukraine funding.

Some Senate Democrats acknowledge the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is dire.

During a trip to Guatemala over the weekend by Senate Democrats to learn more about the migration crisis, second-ranking Senate Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois told Punchbowl News: “We cannot ignore the reality of the numbers and where they’re coming from. We didn’t design the border policies for the volume of this nature. And we have to find a way, as painful as it may be, to bring some order.”

139,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Zelenskyy issues plea for support during Washington visit as Ukraine funding stalls in Congress,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/volodymyr-zelenskyy-pleads-for-support-during-wash/,"WASHINGTON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy kicked off a quick visit to Washington on Monday, warning in a speech at a defense university that Russia may be fighting in Ukraine but its “real target is freedom” in America and around the world. He also issued a personal plea for Congress to break its deadlock and approve continued support for Ukraine.

His time in Washington, which will include meetings on Tuesday at the White House and with Congress, is part of a last-minute push by the Biden administration to convince lawmakers to pass a supplemental funding bill, as officials warn that the money for Ukraine is running out.

President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $61.4 billion for wartime funding for Ukraine as part of a $110 billion package that also includes money for Israel and other national security priorities. But the request is caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration policy and border security. The U.S. has already provided Ukraine $111 billion for its fight against Russia’s 2022 invasion.

“If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his sick clique,” Zelenskyy told an audience of military leaders and students at the National Defense University. “Ukrainians haven’t given up and won’t give up. We know what to do. And you can count on Ukraine. And we hope just as much to be able to count on you.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who introduced the Ukrainian president, said America’s commitment to Ukraine is unshakeable and supporting the war is critical to ensuring the security of the U.S. and its allies.

“America’s commitments must be honored. America’s security must be defended. And America’s word must be kept,” Austin said.

He said Zelenskyy is “living proof that a single person’s leadership can help rally an embattled democracy and inspire the free world and change the course of history.”

With Congress in its final week before leaving for the holidays, questions remain as to whether Republicans will be able to come to an agreement on any rounds of future funding for Ukraine or Israel without White House concessions on border security as illegal crossings surge. But any border package also runs the risk of alienating some Democrats.

This is Zelenskyy’s third visit to Washington since the war began, and he appeared at NDU wearing his trademark Army green long-sleeve shirt - emblazoned with “I’M UKRAINIAN.” His lobbying task, however, has gotten increasingly difficult, from the hero’s welcome he received in the Capitol last year, to the bitterly divided Congress this year.

He noted that 82 years ago on this day the U.S. went to combat in Europe, as then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the declaration of war against Germany. Now, he said, as war rages in his country, though the U.S. has no troops on the ground in Ukraine, it is supplying critically needed weapons and equipment.

“Every one of you here understands what it means for a soldier to wait for ammunition, waiting for weeks, months without knowing if support will come at all,” he told the university audience. “When the free world hesitates, that’s when dictatorships celebrate.”

According to the Defense Department, there is about $4.8 billion remaining in presidential drawdown authority, which pulls weapons from existing U.S. stockpiles and sends them quickly to the war front, and about $1.1 billion left in funding to replenish the U.S. military stockpiles.

John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, told reporters Monday that Zelenskyy’s visit comes at a critical time.

“This is exactly the right time to be having President Zelenskyy in town to have these discussions, because of what’s going on in Ukraine, the increased activity we’re seeing by the Russian armed forces as winter approaches, but also what’s going on on Capitol Hill,” said Kirby.

He said Biden will make clear to Zelenskyy when they meet that the White House is standing firm on the supplemental budget request. White House spokesman Andrew Bates said top Office of Management and Budget, National Security Council and White House legislative affairs officials have continued to press the case for the funding.

140,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Voter turnout plunges below 30% in Hong Kong election after rules shut out pro-democracy candidates,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/hong-kong-voter-turnout-plunges-below-30-after-rul/,"HONG KONG — Voter turnout plunged below 30% in Hong Kong’s first district council elections since new rules introduced under Beijing’s guidance effectively shut out all pro-democracy candidates, setting a record low since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

According to official data on Monday, 27.5% of the city’s 4.3 million registered voters cast ballots in Sunday’s polls - significantly less than the record 71.2% who participated in the last elections held at the height of anti-government protests in 2019. The pro-democracy camp won those polls in a landslide victory, in a clear rebuke of the government’s handling of the protests.

Beijing loyalists are expected to take control of the district councils after Sunday’s elections, with results showing big pro-government parties winning most directly elected seats.

“The newly elected district councilors come from diverse backgrounds,” Hong Kong leader John Lee said. “They will make the work in the districts more multidimensional … better aligning with the interests of the citizens.”

The district councils, which primarily handle municipal matters such as organizing construction projects and public facilities, were Hong Kong’s last major political bodies mostly chosen by the public.

But under new electoral rules introduced under a Beijing order that only “patriots” should administer the city, candidates must secure endorsements from at least nine members of government-appointed committees that are mostly packed with Beijing loyalists, making it virtually impossible for any pro-democracy candidates to run.

PHOTOS: Voter turnout plunges below 30% in Hong Kong election after rules shut out pro-democracy candidates

An amendment passed in July also slashed the proportion of directly elected seats from about 90% to about 20%.

Many prominent pro-democracy activists have also been arrested or have fled the territory after Beijing imposed a harsh national security law in response to the 2019 protests.

Critics say the low voter turnout reflects the public sentiment toward the “patriots” only system and the government’s crackdown on dissent.

The previous record low for participation in the council elections since the handover to Chinese rule was 35.8% in 1999.

The electoral changes further narrowed political freedoms in the city, following a separate overhaul for the legislature in 2021. Following those changes, turnout in the last legislative election two years ago plunged to 30% from 58% in 2016.

Lee on Sunday said the council elections were the “last piece of the puzzle” in implementing the principle of “patriots” administering the city.

Government officials have downplayed turnout as a measure of the overhaul’s success, but stepped up efforts to promote the polls. Lee’s administration held carnivals, an outdoor concert and offered free admission to some museums to encourage voting.

Kenneth Chan, professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, said the low turnout was not the result of political apathy or a coordinated boycott, but rather “a widespread political disengagement by design” under the revised rules, with most people understanding that they were “disinvited.”

“The record low turnout must be hugely humiliating for the government and its allies given the unprecedented propaganda campaigns and ubiquitous mobilization,” he said.

Sunday’s elections were extended by 1 1/2 hours because of the failure of the electronic voter registration system. Multiple politicians said the glitch would affect their chances of winning because some residents gave up voting before authorities implemented a contingency plan.

David Lok, chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, refused to comment on the turnout and said it was unclear whether some voters were unable to cast ballots due to the system failure.

“I can’t rule out this possibility,” he said. “If they can’t vote due to our errors, I feel remorseful.”"
141,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Biden is hosting a Hanukkah ceremony at the White House as fears mount about rising antisemitism,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/biden-is-hosting-hanukkah-ceremony-at-white-house-/,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is hosting a White House reception Monday evening to mark Hanukkah, celebrating the festival of lights as he has continued to denounce rising antisemitism in the U.S. and abroad amid the Israel-Hamas war.

The president, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will attend the event with nearly 800 guests. Invitees include Holocaust survivors, members of Congress, state and local officials, entertainers, and leaders from across the Jewish religious denominations, the White House says.

A menorah is lit nightly during the eight-day Jewish festival, which this year is being celebrated from Dec. 7 until Friday.

The White House reception will be led by Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, Senior Rabbi at Central Synagogue in New York City, and feature menorah lighting by Emhoff and White House staff that are descendants of Holocaust survivors.

Biden plans to talk about how Hanukkah is a timeless story of miracles, and that - even in dark times - we can find the light, the White House says.

The Biden administration in May announced what it called the first-ever national strategy to counter antisemitism. That laid out more than 100 actions, including a series of steps to raise awareness and understanding of antisemitism and the threat it poses around the U.S.

Still, antisemitism has only intensified in some quarters since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants sparked Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged its members to demand an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.

The husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, Emhoff is the first Jewish person to be the spouse of one of the country’s nationally elected leaders. Last week, he presided over the lighting ceremony of a massive menorah in front of the White House to mark Hanukkah’s first night, saying then that American Jews are “feeling alone” and “in pain.”

The White House supported a since-expired, temporary pause in the fighting as Hamas released some of the hostages it held in Gaza, and is pushing for another truce - but the fighting continues in the meantime.

On Saturday, Liz Magill, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, resigned amid pressure from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy.

Universities across the U.S. have been accused of failing to protect Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from the war in Gaza."
142,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Report says United Arab Emirates is trying nearly 90 detainees on terror charges during COP28 summit,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/united-arab-emirates-is-trying-nearly-90-detainees/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Arab Emirates is conducting a mass trial of nearly 90 prisoners on terrorism charges as it hosts the United Nations’ COP28 climate summit, including one man whose case was highlighted by demonstrators at the negotiations, an activist organization reported Monday.

Emirati authorities did not immediately respond to questions over the report by the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a group run by Emirati Hamad al-Shamsi, who lives in exile in Istanbul after being named on a terrorism list by the UAE himself. The state-run WAM news agency also has not run a report on the trial.

Al-Shamsi gathered the information from multiple individuals with direct knowledge of the trial.

Those on trial face charges of “establishing a terrorist organization, supporting and financing it,” the center said in a statement. The center “is highly troubled by the UAE’s apparent fabrication of new charges to extend the sentences of those already released, reflecting the Emirati authorities’ ongoing suppression of dissent and civil society.”

Among those charged in the case is Ahmed Mansoor, the recipient of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. Mansoor repeatedly drew the ire of authorities in the UAE by calling for a free press and democratic freedoms in the autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms.

Mansoor was targeted with Israeli spyware on his iPhone in 2016 likely deployed by the Emirati government ahead of his 2017 arrest and sentencing to 10 years in prison over his activism. On Saturday, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch held a demonstration in which they displayed Mansoor’s face in the U.N.-administered Blue Zone in a protest carefully watched by Emirati officials.

Others among the 87 charged include the activist Nasser bin Ghaith, an academic held since August 2015 over his tweets. He was among dozens of people sentenced in the wake of a wide-ranging crackdown in the UAE following the 2011 Arab Spring protests. Those demonstrations saw the Islamists rise to power in several Mideast nations, a political bloc that the UAE government views as a threat to its system of hereditary rule.

The UAE, while socially liberal in many regards compared with its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression. That’s been seen at COP28, where there have been none of the typical protests outside of the venue as activists worry about the country’s vast network of surveillance cameras.

“The UAE has attempted during its COP28 presidency to persuade the world of its openness to different perspectives,” said activist James Lynch of the group FairSquare. “The decision to lay new terrorism charges on this scale in the middle of the talks, when UAE is under the global spotlight, is a giant slap in the face to the country’s human rights community and the COP process.”"
143,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Critics pan draft text at U.N. climate talks as watered down as COP28 nears its finale in Dubai,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/critics-pan-draft-text-at-un-climate--writethru-12/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Countries moved closer to reaching what critics called a watered-down final deal Monday, avoiding calls from more than 100 nations to phase out planet-warming fossil fuels as United Nations climate talks in Dubai neared their culmination.

A new draft released Monday afternoon on what’s known as the global stocktake - the part of talks that assesses where the world is with its climate goals and how it can reach them - called for countries to reduce “consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.”

The release triggered a frenzy of fine-tuning by government envoys and gimlet-eye analysis by advocacy groups, just hours before the planned late morning finish to the talks on Tuesday - even though many observers expect the finale to run over time, as is common at the annual U.N. talks.

Activists said the text was written by the COP28 presidency, run by an Emirati oil company CEO, and pounced on its perceived shortcomings. It called for “phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption” but fell fall short of a widespread push to phase out fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal altogether.

The COP presidency, in a statement, countered that the text was a “huge step forward” and was now “in the hands of the parties, who we trust to do what is best for humanity and the planet.”

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber skipped a planned news conference and headed straight into a meeting with delegates just after 6:30 p.m.

“We have a text and we need to agree on the text,” al-Jaber said. “The time for discussion is coming to an end and there’s no time for hesitation. The time to decide is now.”

He added: “We must still close many gaps. We don’t have time to waste.”

Critics said there was a lot to do.

“The word ‘phase-out’ has been phased out,” said Li Shuo, director of the Asia Society Policy Institute. “We need to phase in the word phase-out. I think there’s still a chance for countries to do so.”

Added Andreas Sieber, a climate activists with 350.org: “What we have seen now is our fears come true.”

Jean Su from the Center for Biological Diversity said the text “moves disastrously backward from original language offering a phaseout of fossil fuels.”

“If this race-to-the-bottom monstrosity gets enshrined as the final word, this crucial COP will be a failure,” Su said.

The text “is extremely disappointing, concerning, and nowhere close to the level of ambition people around the world deserve,” said Rachel Cleetus, from the Union of Concerned Scientists.

But Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa said the “text lays the ground for transformational change.”

“This is the first COP where the word fossil fuels are actually included in the draft decision. This is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era,” he said.

The draft noted that some $4.3 trillion needs to be invested annually through 2030 in order to reach ambitions of net-zero emissions of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere by mid-century. It said financing needs for adaptation were but a fraction of current outlays.

Earlier Monday, visibly tired and frustrated top U.N. officials urged COP28 climate talks to push harder for an end to fossil fuels, warning that time is running out for action that could keep the world at or below the internationally agreed-upon warming threshold.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it was “time to go into overdrive, to negotiate in good faith, and rise to the challenge.” He said negotiators at the COP28 summit in particular must focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and climate justice.

“We can’t keep kicking the can down the road,” Guterres said. “We are out of road and almost out of time.”

Emirati officials cancelled a hastily called news conference with al-Jaber, then cancelled another with another official in the early afternoon. They offered no explanation for the cancellations, which drew into question an earlier promise by al-Jaber to bring the COP to an end sharply at 11 a.m. Tuesday. They were part of a series of cancellations by prominent negotiators.

At one event that did still take place that included members of the presidency of the current and previous COP, climate activist Licypriya Kangujam came on stage to protest against the use of fossil fuels before being ushered away.

The presidency of the conference “recognizes that for this to be viewed as a success, we need to find some agreement on fossil fuels,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canadian environment minister and one of eight super-negotiators tasked with helping find common ground. “I think if we can’t do that, people will see this as a failure, even though we’ve agreed on lots of other good things.”

Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told journalists Monday morning that “we do not have a minute to lose in this crucial final stretch.”

“One thing is for certain: I win, you lose is a recipe for collective failure,” he said.

Negotiators from powerhouses United States and China were working together Monday morning.

One of the major players in all this is India, which in 2021 torpedoed the idea of a “phase-out” of coal but then in 2022 proposed the idea of phasing out all fossil fuels, not just coal, which never got on the agenda in last year’s climate talks.

The world’s most populous nation, and No. 3 carbon dioxide emitter, is trying to be both ambitious yet keep the backbone of its economy, coal, said Vaibhav Chaturvedi of New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Earlier this month, Raosaheb Danve Patil, India’s junior coal minister said that they will increase coal production to 1.5 billion tons by 2030 to meet growing demand.

Alden Meyer, an analyst with climate think tank E3G, said Saudi Arabia was trying to mobilize the other members of the OPEC oil cartel to object to any inclusion of fossil fuels in the text.

Canada’s Guilbeault said OPEC countries are “being very unwilling to even contemplate even a conversation, and I think that’s unhelpful.”

Seve Paeniu, Finance Minister of Tuvalu, said states at a press conference calling for a fossil fuel phase out were “addressing the oil producing states, particularly the Arab States, the Saudis in particular. We wanted them to come on board, we recognize that their countries and their economies depend very much on fossil fuel.”

Oscar Davila, of the Greater Stockholm fire department, told Swedish public broadcaster SVT that there were five people inside the elevator “and they are seriously injured.” Further details about their injuries weren’t immediately available.

The construction elevator plummeted 20 meters (66 feet) in Sundbyberg, in the north of the city, Kurt Jonsson, a spokesman for the rescue service, told Swedish news agency TT.

Police said that no foul play was suspected and a preliminary investigation has been launched into “work environment violations.”

Swedish media carried photos of first responders at the site and the area cordoned off.

A spokesman for the company that manufactured the elevator told the Aftonbladet tabloid that that type has been used around the world for more than 20 years, and the company had never been involved in such an incident before."
146,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,Vladimir Putin visits a shipyard to oversee the commissioning of new Russian nuclear submarines,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/vladimir-putin-visits-shipyard-to-oversee-commissi/,"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday traveled to a shipyard to attend the commissioning of new nuclear submarines, a visit that showcased the country’s nuclear might amid the fighting in Ukraine.

Putin‘s trip to the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk in Russia‘s northwestern Archangelsk region comes three days after he declared his intention to seek another six-year term.

Putin announced his decision to run in the March 17 presidential election, which he is all but certain to win, while speaking to soldiers who fought in Ukraine after a Kremlin award ceremony - a setting that underlined his focus on the military action in Ukraine.

Monday’s visit to Sevmash, where Putin oversaw raising the navy’s flag on the newly built Emperor Alexander III and the Krasnoyarsk nuclear submarines, also appeared to emphasize his focus on bolstering Russia‘s nuclear forces amid the tensions with the U.S. and other NATO allies over Ukraine.

Putin has cast his decision to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 as a response to what he described as Western efforts to threaten Russia and undermine its security, while Ukraine and its allies have denounced the action as an unprovoked act of aggression.

Speaking at the shipyard, Putin pledged to carry out plans to modernize the Russian navy.

The Emperor Alexander III is the seventh Borei-class atomic-powered submarine to enter service. Each of them is armed with 16 nuclear-tipped Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Putin announced that three more such submarines are under construction. They are part of Russia’s nuclear triad, which also includes land-based nuclear missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers.

The Krasnoyarsk is a nuclear-powered submarine of the new Yasen type. It’s armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes, and is designed to hunt for enemy submarines and is also capable of attacking ground targets. Putin said that another five Yasen-class submarines are being built."

President says government will help for now,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/rohingya-muslims-in-indonesia-struggle-to-find-she/,"BANDA ACEH, Indonesia — His face showed exhaustion, restlessness, and confusion. It has been more than 36 hours since Muhammad Amin landed in Indonesia. He arrived in a wooden boat with 136 other Rohingya Muslims who left their refugee camp in Bangladesh. Their boat had been at sea for nearly 1 1/2 months, with no water or food for days.

Amin, 27, wore a Paris Saint-Germain soccer jersey that bore the marks of being worn for days. He, together with his wife, his children and hundreds of other Rohingya refugees, tried to get some rest as they waited at a skateboard park in the city of Banda Aceh, next to the governor’s office. They have been relocated five times in less than two days and are yet to find shelter.

Two boats carrying two groups of more than 300 Rohingya Muslims, including emaciated women and children, reached Indonesia’s northernmost Aceh province on Sunday. A third boat, carrying more refugees, remains missing. The U.N. refugee agency warned that people onboard could die if more is not done to rescue them.

Amin and his family left the refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh and arrived at Lamreh village in Indonesia’s northmost Ache province.

“It was not safe at the camp in Bangladesh,” he said while holding his two toddler daughters to calm them down. “ We, the Rohingya men, had to keep on guard every night. We couldn’t sleep.” Amin claimed that they were being shot at, and one night a couple of Rohingya refugees got killed.

About 740,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, following a brutal counterinsurgency campaign. Myanmar security forces have been accused of mass rapes, killings and the burning of thousands of Rohingya homes, and international courts are considering whether their actions constitute genocide.

The refugees have been trying to find shelter in other countries including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia.

After their boat docked at Lamreh village, Amin and the other Rohingya refugees saw the locals were unwelcoming of their arrival.

On Sunday evening, residents loaded the Rohingya Muslims in four trucks and took them to the place near the governor’s office, about 1.5 hours from where they landed.

When they arrived, police officers drove them for another hour to a scout camp in Pidie regency, only for residents there to block the camp’s entrance and deny them entry. Authorities escorted them to a convention center run by the Ministry of Social Affairs, but locals still wouldn’t allow them to stay.

Finally, the refugees were driven back to where the governor’s office was located. They stayed overnight in a convention hall complex in Banda Aceh city owned by the government.

Shahidul Islam, 34, arrived with Amin. He said they came to Indonesia after seeing some Rohyinga Muslims, including his relatives, safely arriving in the Southeast Asian country.

“I came here to reunite with my family. But now they are not allowing us in. So many people are sick, more than before” Islam said. He added that he is looking for a better life and asked the Indonesian governmnet to help.

Since November, more than 1,500 Rohingya refugees have arrived by boat in Indonesia’s Aceh province. Some were denied landing by the residents in Aceh Utara district and Sabang island, sparking concerns from human rights organizations.

Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo on Monday said that the Indonesian government will still help the refugees temporarily.

“For now we will accommodate them, temporarily. We are still talking to international organizations, such as UNHR, etc., since the locals don’t accept them,” Widodo told reporters in Jakarta.

On Sunday Ann Maymann, head of UNHCR representative who was in Banda Aceh told reporters Sunday that Rohingya refugees needed a safe place with help from Indonesia’s government.

“It is the government that should decide (where refugees should stay). That is their authority. And when they decide, it will work. So I am sure we can manage this,” Maymann said

Indonesia’s government suspected a surge in human trafficking because of the growing number of Rohingya Muslims who entered the country over the past few weeks, especially in Aceh.

Most of the refugees leaving by sea attempt to reach Muslim-majority Malaysia in search of work. Indonesia, where Muslims comprise nearly 90% of the country’s 277 million people, has been detaining them.

Transfer of the two Sandown class vessels, which are designed to help clear mines from coastal waters, comes as Britain and Norway announce plans for a new maritime coalition to increase support for Ukraine in the war with Russia.

The coalition will work with the Ukrainian navy to expand its forces in the Black Sea, develop a Ukrainian Marine Corps and enhance the use of river patrol craft to defend inland and coastal waterways, British authorities said.

“These minehunters will deliver vital capability to Ukraine, which will help save lives at sea and open up vital export routes, which have been severely limited since (Russian President Vladimir) Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion,’’ Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.

The government said Monday that it would introduce emergency legislation to make the ban on supporters effective immediately. It will end on Feb. 12 with a possible extension to follow.

This past weekend’s professional soccer matches were postponed following a series of violent incidents at matches and last week’s riot that occurred outside a volleyball game believed to be led by organized soccer fan groups.

The 31-year-old police officer who was injured in the clashes remains hospitalized in a coma after being hit in the left leg by a flare, causing extensive bleeding and cardiac arrest.

“This murderous attack against a policeman is not the first incident of extreme fan violence in recent years. Criminals in the guise of sports fans are committing serious offenses, seriously injuring and killing people,” government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis told reporters.

He said all 14 clubs competing in the top-flight Super League will have to install surveillance cameras inside stadiums and use personalized ticketing systems that require the holder to show identification upon entry before being allowed to admit supporters.

The security systems, including a network of high-resolution surveillance cameras inside stadiums, would have to adhere to standards set by soccer’s governing body in Europe, UEFA, Marinakis said.

An 18-year-old man has been arrested and taken into police custody in connection with the police officer’s injury to face charges of attempted murder. The man, who has not been identified, appeared at an arraignment hearing Monday after being escorted to court in handcuffs by police. He was given until Thursday to prepare his defense.

Violence has plagued Greek soccer for decades despite repeated efforts to crack down on the supporters’ associations blamed for the attacks, mostly outside stadiums.

Olympiakos, under new Portuguese head coach Carlos Carvalhal, will face Serbia’s Backa Topola in the Europa League at home Thursday without fans as a result of the decision.

But Greek clubs Panathinaikos and PAOK will conclude their European matches with fans. Panathinaikos hosts Maccabi Haifa in Athens Thursday in the Europa League and PAOK hosts HJK Helsinki in the Conference League also on Thursday in Thessaloniki."
150,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"Iraq scrambles to contain fighting between U.S troops, Iran-backed groups, fearing Gaza spillover",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/iraq-scrambles-to-contain-fighting-between-us-troo/,"BAGHDAD — Dozens of attacks on U.S. military facilities by Iran-backed factions in Iraq over the past two months have forced the government in Baghdad to perform a balancing act that is becoming more difficult by the day.

A rocket attack on the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Friday marked a further escalation as Iraqi officials scramble to contain the ripple effects of the Israel-Hamas war.

Iran holds considerable sway in Iraq and a coalition of Iran-backed groups brought Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani to power in October 2022. But at the same time, there are some 2,000 U.S. forces stationed in Iraq under an agreement with Baghdad, mainly to counter the extremist Islamic State group.

Baghdad also relies heavily on Washington’s sanctions waivers to buy electricity from Iran, and since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq’s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the U.S. Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq’s supply of dollars.

Al-Sudani’s predecessors also had to walk a delicate line between Tehran and Washington, but the Israel-Hamas war has considerably upped the stakes.

Since the onset of the war on Oct. 7, at least 84 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. The militants say their attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s backing of Israel and its military presence in Iraq and Syria.

Al-Sudani has condemned the attacks and U.S. counter-strikes as a violation of his country’s sovereignty. He also ordered authorities to pursue militants involved in the attacks, most of which did not cause injuries or major damage. His office declined further comment.

Washington has sent messages that its patience is wearing thin.

After the embassy attack, the Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “made clear (to al-Sudani) that attacks against U.S. forces must stop.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told al-Sudani that Washington expects Iraqi officials to take more action to prevent such attacks, and believes they have the capability to do so, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.

During a recent trip to the region, CIA Director William Burns warned al-Sudani of “harsh consequences” if Iraq does not act to stop the attacks, an Iraqi official said.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.

In a call with the Iraqi premier earlier this month, Blinken said that the Americans would take matters into their own hands, arguing that Baghdad had not done enough to pursue the perpetrators, according to two Iraqi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Two days later, a U.S. strike on a drone launch site near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed five militants.

The U.S. and much of the international community have scrambled to prevent the war in the besieged Gaza Strip from expanding across the region.

Analyst Renad Mansour said he believes Iran is making sure the attacks remain below a threshold that would provoke a major U.S. response.

“Both Iran and Iraq have maintained thus far a clear line that, at the moment, Iraq cannot turn into a playground that could destabilize the Sudani government,” said Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.

He said that’s partially due to Iraq‘s role of passing messages between Washington and Tehran.

Sometimes the messenger is al-Sudani.

In early November, Blinken met with al-Sudani in Baghdad a day before the Iraqi prime minister was set to visit Tehran. Al-Sudani had won a specific promise from the militias that no attacks would be launched during Blinken’s visit, according to an Iraqi official and a member of the Kataib Hezbollah militia. Following the visit, al-Sudani carried a message from Blinken to Iran to restrain the militias.

Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

A week after the Iraqi premier’s diplomatic efforts, the United States extended Iraq’s sanctions waiver by four months to purchase Iranian electricity. Iran-hawks in Washington criticized the move, saying it would shore up revenue for Tehran while its proxies are at war with Israel.

Mansour says the U.S. has used the sanctions waiver as “one of its cards” in economy-centered efforts to pressure Iran and Iraq.

Unlike Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, seen as Iran‘s most powerful proxy in the region, Iraq’s militias have so far only played a limited role in the conflict.

For now, only small number of militiamen from Iraq are in southern Lebanon, near Israel‘s northern border, said the official from the Kataib Hezbollah group. He said the Iraqis are working on “battle management” alongside Hezbollah and representatives of Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years and is currently battling Israel.

He said the Iran-backed groups in Iraq do not want the conflict to spread across the region, but are prepared to respond with force to any attacks.

Should Iran and allies choose to escalate, al-Sudani’s government will likely be unable to rein them in or prevent consequences on Iraqi soil, said Iyad al-Anbar, a political science professor at Baghdad University.

“And this is why all al-Sudani has been able to do is try to bring some calm through statements,” said al-Anbar.

151,[District of Columbia] https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/world/,"A day of two prime ministers in Poland begins the delayed transition to centrist, pro-EU government",https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/11/day-of-two-prime-ministers-in-poland-begins-delaye/,"WARSAW, Poland — A power transition began Monday in the Polish parliament, where the outgoing national conservative leaders made their farewell statements as a majority of lawmakers prepared to elect a new prime minister, the centrist, pro-EU political veteran Donald Tusk.

The power transition comes two months since Poles turned out in huge numbers to vote for change in a national election. The transition was delayed for weeks by the president, who chose to keep his political allies in office as long as possible.

“READY, STEADY, GO!” tweeted Tusk, who - if all goes as planned - will be chosen as the new prime minister by bedtime.

Szymon Holownia, a former TV showman who leads a party allied with Tusk, became the speaker if parliament last month and has been trying to encourage more dignified behavior in the sometimes raucous assembly. Parliamentary proceedings have ignited widespread curiosity and emotions, and led to a spike in the number of subscribers to the Sejm’s YouTube channel.

A Warsaw cinema which livestreamed Monday’s proceedings drew dozens of spectators who munched popcorn and erupted in laughter as the outgoing prime minister spoke.

The change of power in Poland is felt as hugely consequential for the 38 million citizens of the central European nation, where collective anger produced a record-high turnout to replace a government that had been eroding democratic norms.

There is relief for many women who saw reproductive rights eroded and LGBTQ+ people who faced a government hate campaign that drove some to leave the country.

Law and Justice supporters, however, fear the new government will promote more liberal policies that conflict with many of their conservative views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

The change holds important implications for Ukraine and the EU as well.

Tusk, a past EU leader, is expected to improve Warsaw’s standing in Brussels. His leadership of the EU’s fifth largest member by population will boost centrist, pro-EU forces at a time when euroskeptics, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, are gaining strength.

Poland’s outgoing nationalist government was initially one of Kyiv’s strongest allies after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but ties have worsened as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers has angered Poles who say their livelihoods are threatened.

A blockade by Polish truckers at the border with Ukraine counts among the many problems Tusk will have to tackle immediately. The protest has held up the shipment of some military equipment that charities are importing, and Tusk has accused the outgoing government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of mishandling the situation.

In a speech that traditionally launches a government in power, but was in fact a parting speech, outgoing Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described what he viewed as the successes of his government and his desire for reconciliation in a society so divided it seems sometimes at war with itself.

“We must end the Polish-Polish war,” Morawiecki said, to applause from his supporters but laughter from the others “Let’s choose dialogue, let’s look for what unites us.”

Morawiecki’s government will later face a confidence vote he is expected to lose, bringing an end to his premiership exactly six years after he assumed the office on Dec. 11, 2017.

Simple arithmetic indicates he has no chance of surviving the vote. His Law and Justice party won more seats than any other party in the Oct. 15 election but lost its parliamentary majority. A bloc of parties allied with Tusk that range from left-wing to conservative won a majority of 248 seats in the 460-seat body.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the Law and Justice leader who has been the driving force in the country for the past eight years, pledged that no matter what happens his party would pursue its goals until another victory is possible in the future.

The Sejm is scheduled to elect Tusk later Monday. He is to address lawmakers Tuesday and he will face a confidence vote which he seems sure to win given that he is backed by a majority.

It’s a day keenly awaited by former President Lech Walesa, the anti-communist freedom fighter who had despaired at the unraveling of the democracy he fought for under Kaczynski, his bitter foe. Though Walesa was hospitalized last week for COVID-19 and remains weak, he traveled early from his home in Gdansk to attend the parliamentary session.

Walesa arrived wearing a sweatshirt with the word “Constitution” - a slogan against Law and Justice. He sat in a balcony above the lawmakers with other dignitaries. Many stood to applaud him, chanting his name.

Law and Justice lawmakers did not clap and remained seated.

The final act in the transition of power will take place when President Andrzej Duda swears in Tusk and his government, expected on Wednesday.

Tusk plans to fly to Brussels for an EU summit later in the week where discussions critical for Ukraine’s future are expected as the nation fights off the Russian invasion. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Russia’s closest ally in the EU, is demanding that Ukraine’s membership in the EU and billions of euros in funding meant for the war-torn country be taken off the agenda.

Morawiecki’s government reacted to an economic dispute with Kyiv during the election campaign by banning Ukraine food imports and saying it had stopped sending military aid to Ukraine. Last week, Tusk said he would seek solutions to the truckers’ protest that take into account their financial needs but also regional security.

152,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Opponents say Dominion’s offshore wind farm endangers whales. Scientists say it doesn't.,https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-11/dominion-energy-whale-deaths-wind-farm-renewable-energy,"Read the original article on WHRO's website.

A series of whale deaths along the East Coast early this year has spurred an ongoing dispute over the burgeoning offshore wind industry.

Several of the deaths happened in Virginia Beach and Cape Charles. Two were humpbacks; one was a critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, later determined to have been struck by a vessel. Another right whale was also caught entangled in fishing line off the Outer Banks in North Carolina.

Around the same time, more than a dozen humpback whales were found dead along the coasts of New Jersey and New York over the span of a few months — the latest in what scientists call an “unusual mortality event” stretching back to 2016. Warming waters driven by climate change are bringing humpbacks closer to shore, while cargo shipments carried on big ships are also on the rise.

Scientists later said most of the deaths were caused by ship strikes.

But some local politicians and national conservative pundits pointed the finger somewhere else: offshore wind development.

More than a dozen offshore wind projects are in various stages of permitting along the East Coast. The Biden administration considers the nascent industry a key part of its climate policy, setting a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of electricity generated from offshore wind farms by 2030, or enough to power more than 10 million homes.

In January, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused offshore wind projects of killing “a huge number of whales” on his show. Fox News also linked the right whale death in Virginia Beach to Dominion Energy’s project.

Thirty mayors in New Jersey called for a moratorium on offshore wind activity until further investigation into the whale deaths. The uproar also fueled a few “save the whales” rallies, including in New Jersey and Rhode Island.

But scientists say there’s nothing to back up such claims.

“There’s no scientific evidence that even a single whale death has been linked to offshore wind energy development,” said Andrew Read, a marine biology professor at Duke University who also serves on the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission, an independent government agency that advises on federal policy affecting marine mammals.

The biggest proven threats to whales are vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear —often tied to existing industries like shipping and commercial fishing, Read said.

Now, two conservative think tanks have notified the government they plan to sue to halt Dominion Energy's planned wind farm off Virginia Beach, arguing the project threatens the endangered right whale.

The two think tanks — the Illinois-based Heartland Institute and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow — have a long history of rejecting the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity, primarily burning fossil fuels like oil and gas. Both groups have opposed efforts to shift to renewable energy.

James Taylor, president of Heartland, said he views renewable energy as the wrong direction for the country economically.

""We're looking to protect [the] American standard of living. We're looking to protect affordable, reliable energy,” Taylor said. “But when you also see this environmental devastation, it just begs for us to get involved and to stand up for wildlife as well.”

Critics, meanwhile, say the groups are spreading misinformation about the threat to whales as a tool to stop wind projects from moving forward.

“It’s utilizing something that is perceived as environmentally-friendly,” said Ruth McKie, a senior lecturer in criminology at De Montfort University in the U.K. who studies organized opposition to climate action.

If filed, the lawsuit would be one of the first to test the argument in court. Lawsuits from landowners and fishing businesses in the Northeast have mentioned whales in a few other recent cases, some of which were already dismissed by a judge.

The controversy is one of several roadblocks the U.S. offshore wind industry faces as it finds its footing.

And Dominion’s Virginia Beach project — which is set to be the nation’s largest commercial wind farm — is now at the forefront.



A strategy to halt renewable energy?

Critics question whether the new legal action is really about wildlife.

“I would be pleased to learn they are concerned about whales, but I’m sure it isn’t so,” Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication, wrote in an email. He cited the Heartland Institute’s history of “ignoring science.”

McKie, the U.K. researcher, said Heartland is known for a decadeslong campaign to discredit the science behind climate change, including annual climate conferences and policy briefs “debunking the myth of global warming.”

The institute had donors in the fossil fuel industry at least up until the mid-2000s, she said. (Heartland denies accusations that former funding from the industry has any influence on its current activities.)

McKie sees the focus on whales as part of a shift in strategy. The new “save the whales” campaign could represent a shift from targeting climate science to undermining climate action, such as the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

“It’s not necessarily going to stop it. It’s about delaying it as long as possible,” she said. “Every time you can stop an offshore wind development, you’re delaying that energy transition.”

Taylor, the president of Heartland, said protecting vulnerable species “should stand regardless of who is on what side,” accusing environmentalists of “turning a blind eye” in order to safeguard wind projects.

Heartland has been critical of the Endangered Species Act in the past, sometimes even calling for its repeal. Now, the group is taking a page out of environmentalists’ playbook.

“If there's anything that environmental groups used to tell us is that, ‘look, if there's a reasonable chance that you're going to do harm to plants, to animals, to wildlife — at the very least, slow down, take a time out and look at it,’” Taylor said. “And that's a standard that should apply here.”



Endangered whales and wind farms

Read, of Duke University, said he’s glad endangered whales are getting so much attention. But he’d like the public to focus on proven threats to the species, like boat strikes and fishing entanglement.

“In terms of whale conservation, wind energy development is not very high on my list of things to keep me awake at night,” Read said.

There are fewer than 350 North Atlantic Right Whales left in the ocean. Their dwindling population makes losing even one of the whales a major concern.

The whales’ annual migration takes them up the East Coast, from their breeding grounds off Florida and Georgia to summer feeding grounds off eastern Canada, Read said.

Under the Endangered Species Act, federal officials have to weigh impacts on right whales when considering offshore wind projects. The government’s biological opinion found that the Virginia project is not likely to jeopardize the whales’ population.

That’s based on analysis from federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that says the creatures can be adequately protected by mitigation measures. Scientists say they plan to research more about potential impacts from offshore wind infrastructure on whales’ food supply of tiny zooplankton.

The Heartland Institute and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow argue the government’s analysis is flawed and therefore violates the Endangered Species Act.

They recently notified the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and National Marine Fisheries Service of their intent to sue in 60 days — a step required by law before filing suit. (BOEM declined to comment, citing pending litigation.)

Collister Johnson, a senior adviser with the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow and former board chair of the Virginia Port Authority, said federal officials haven’t sufficiently considered the cumulative effects of building multiple wind farms in the Atlantic, rather than looking at each individually.

“It doesn't take a scientist to understand that if you're putting thousands of these giant wind turbines out in the migratory path of the right whale, you're going to have a negative impact,” Johnson said.

Johnson and other opponents argue that site surveys done by offshore wind companies ahead of construction could have played a role in this year’s whale deaths.

But marine officials say the acoustic energy used in those surveys is weaker than those used by oil companies that need to penetrate deep into the seafloor, and no stronger than beams used by fishing vessels. The Heartland Institute has in the past supported oil and gas exploration along the Eastern Seaboard — citing federal analysis concluding seismic surveys pose no significant threat to marine life.

In a page on its website responding to concerns about offshore wind and whales, NOAA Fisheries officials acknowledge that acoustic trauma in whales is very challenging to assess, but say they plan to keep looking at samples from necropsied animals.

“Strandings and inconclusive necropsies have occurred long before offshore wind was a factor, so correlating the two now is not based in science,” NOAA wrote.

Dominion Energy declined to comment specifically on the pending litigation. But the utility’s federal permitting requires that it take several actions to protect marine life including whales, said environmental manager Mitchell Jabs.

“North Atlantic Right Whales were a consideration from the very beginning of the project,” she said.

Those measures include using “bubble curtains” to reduce underwater noise during pile-driving, maintaining lower vessel speed limits and using visual and acoustic monitoring to spot whales nearby.

The Nature Conservancy and NOAA also announced they plan to study fish behavior around the Virginia turbines through 2027, including their responses to construction noise.

Dominion has already started receiving some wind turbine foundations and plans to start installing them in the water in the spring.

153,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,"Here's the latest fallout at Harvard, MIT and Penn after the antisemitism hearing",https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-11/heres-the-latest-fallout-at-harvard-mit-and-penn-after-the-antisemitism-hearing,"Controversy over last week's congressional hearing regarding antisemitism on college campuses continues to play out at Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania.

Over the weekend, Penn President Liz Magill resignedafter calls mounted for her removal among students, faculty and donors. Now, all eyes are on Harvard and whether its president, Claudine Gay, will also step down amid intense pressure.

Critics say Magill, Gay and MIT president Sally Kornbluth failed to convince Congress and the public that they can adequately protect their Jewish students. Those concerns largely erupted after the university presidents were asked whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate their school's code of conduct. Many felt their answers were too legalistic and lacked moral clarityat a time when both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise in the country.

But not everyone is in favor of their departure. A growing number of students and faculty oppose the calls for the presidents to go, arguing that such measures go against school values around independence and freedom speech.

Here's what to know:

Calls for Gay and Kornbluth's removal remain firm

On Monday, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer told Morning Edition that he supported Gay's removal.

""This wasn't the first incident,"" he said. ""Despite the fact that these incidents have been brought to the attention of the president of Harvard and the other presidents, there's been no action.""

Gottheimer was one of the 74 members of Congress who signed a letter last week urging the governing boards of Harvard, Penn and MIT to remove their presidents. Congress continues to investigate their policies and disciplinary procedures.

In an open letter on Sunday night to Harvard's governing boards, alum and billionaire investor Bill Ackman also accused of Gay damaging the university's reputation.

""Knowing what we know now, would Harvard consider Claudine Gay for the position? The answer is definitively 'No,'"" he wrote, adding that the decision of whether to fire Gay ""could not be more straightforward.

Earlier on Sunday, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who posed the question around the schools' code of conduct, ominously wrote on X: ""One down. Two to go."" She added, ""@Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing. The world is watching.""

Support grows for MIT and Harvard presidents

On Monday, the executive committee of the Harvard Alumni Association expressed its support for Gay and asked the university's governing boards to publicly do the same.

""President Gay is the right leader to guide the University during this challenging time,"" the committee wrote. ""We are confident President Gay will address antisemitism, and other forms of hate, effectively and courageously.""

Similarly, over the weekend, more than 650 Harvard faculty members signed a letter to the university's top governing board, urging it to keep Gay as president, The Harvard Crimson reported. They stressed that yielding to such political pressures is at odds with the school's values around academic freedom.

""The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,"" they wrote, according to The Crimson.

At MIT, the university's board said last week it stood by Kornbluth, adding that it has faith in her leadership, judgement and moral compass.

""She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, all of which we reject utterly at MIT,"" the MIT Corporation wroteon Thursday. ""She has our full and unreserved support.""

A moment unlike any other in college history

College campuses have long been a flashpoint for political controversies but the turmoil unfolding on school grounds over the Israel-Hamas war is also unprecedented in many ways.

Angus Johnston, a historian of American student activism at Hostos Community College of The City University of New York, said no issue in recent decades has divided student activists within the same school like the Israel-Hamas conflict.

""It is rare for there to be simultaneous protests on many American campuses where students are taking diametrically opposed positions,"" he said.

That's not only a challenge to navigate for peers, but also for university presidents, who are balancing the interests of students, faculty, donors and even lawmakers.

""The presidents of MIT, Harvard and UPenn were under fire in a tense, polarized Congressional hearing. That's a unique and different environment for most college presidents,"" said Jason Shepard, a communications professor at California State University, Fullerton.

He added that the current political climate is also complicated by social media, which can produce viral moments and knee jerk reactions.

""Ten-second snippets of viral videos can move like wildfire, and this sets up a whole new world for university presidents to effectively communicate with a broad and diverse range of constituencies,"" Shepard said.

This moment in higher education might become even more perilous with the fall of another university president, Johnston said.

""There is a huge amount of pressure right now on college presidents to restrain student protests,"" he said. ""If we see the departure of another very high profile university leader, then that pressure is going to mount even further.""

154,[Virginia] https://www.vpm.org/vpm-news,Civil rights groups appeal court ruling that threatens Voting Rights Act enforcement,https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2023-12-11/civil-rights-groups-appeal-court-ruling-that-threatens-voting-rights-act-enforcement,"Civil rights organizations are asking the full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a ruling by a three-judge panel that threatens to make it harder to enforce the Voting Rights Act's protections against racial discrimination in the election process.

The court filing released Monday by attorneys led by the American Civil Liberties Union marks another step in a case that could become the next U.S. Supreme Court showdown that further weakens the landmark law.

The panel's ruling upheld a lower court decision that found that private individuals and groups — who, for decades, have brought the majority of lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — do not have the right to sue because they are not explicitly named in the law.

That decision came out of a redistricting lawsuit filed by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel, which challenged Arkansas' state House map.

The groups argued that the legislative redistricting plan approved by Republican politicians violates Section 2 by diluting the collective voting power of Black people in Arkansas, where 16.5% of the state's population is Black.

Only 11 out of Arkansas' 100 state House districts, however, are majority-Black districts, where Black voters have a realistic opportunity to elect their preferred representative.

The final outcome of this redistricting case is not expected to affect the 2024 elections for Arkansas' state House, as the filing deadline for next year's candidates passed last month.

But if this dispute over what's known as the private right of action reaches the Supreme Court — where conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have signaled interest in hearing such a case — it could end up limiting the enforcement of Section 2 protections nationwide to the discretion of the head of the Justice Department, where legal resources and the political will of a presidential administration can be limited.

""We will not stand by as this threat is not only happening in Arkansas, but across the country,"" Dominik Whitehead, vice president of campaigns at the NAACP, said Monday at a press conference, calling the ruling a ""clear attack"" on U.S. democracy, voting rights and people of color. ""It's continuing to attack Black folks and making sure they do not have fair representation.""

This 8th Circuit panel's ruling is having ripple effects

The panel's ruling, which strikes down the private right of action under Section 2, only applies to the seven states in the 8th Circuit — Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.

Two weeks after the ruling's release, Republican officials in North Dakota cited the ruling in an effort to defend an election map that was approved by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. Last month, a federal judge struck down that map for diluting the collective power of Native American voters in violation of Section 2. The lawsuit was brought by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, the Spirit Lake Tribe and individual Native American voters.

And outside of the 8th Circuit, Republican officials in other states are now trying to extend the ruling's influence to ongoing redistricting fights around the country.

GOP state officials in Louisiana are pointing to the ruling in their request for the full 5th Circuit to review a congressional redistricting lawsuit brought by Black voters, who are challenging a map that a lower court found is likely to dilute the power of Black Louisianans.

In a friend-of-the-court brief for that case, more than a dozen Republican state attorneys general in Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia argue against a private right of action.

But last month, a 5th Circuit panel concluded that, as private individuals, the Black voters do have a right to sue under Section 2.

Fast Forward U, a hub in Remington for students interested in creating startup companies, will be named Pava Marie LePere Center for Entrepreneurship. The university unveiled the honor Saturday at a memorial service for LaPere, which was attended by Gov. Wes Moore and Mayor Brandon Scott.

LaPere, 26, was instrumental in the center’s formation five years ago, said Christy Wyskiel, Executive Director of Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures. LaPere, who started four businesses in college, including co-founding and becoming chief executive officer of EcoMap Technologies, told Wyskiel that Hopkins needed to provide a space for student entrepreneurs.

Hopkins is also committing $2 million for an endowment for the center.

Fast Foward U was established to help students bring their ideas to market, Wyskiel said. LaPere, who graduated in 2019, designed an accelerator program as a student that gave other students mentorship and funding to move a product ahead. Hopkins would later adopt her design.

“Many of the things we do with students — build teams, raise money, write business plans — are because of her energy and her effort,” Wyskiel said. “To honor her and acknowledge what she brought to the university is to keep the spirit alive of what she hoped Johns Hopkins would bring to entrepreneurs.”

LaPere was found dead at her apartment building in the Mount Vernon neighborhood in late September. Jason Billingsley, 32, was charged with first-degree murder in connection to her death and is being held without bail.

LaPere, who first moved to Baltimore from her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, was a de facto mentor to many in the city, championing entrepreneurship and diverse leadership, Wyskiel said.

EcoMap Technologies, which has around 30 employees and whose main customers are government agencies, nonprofits, universities and industry associations, publishes data maps and contact lists of business, nonprofit, legal and venture capital networks around the country, including an overview of Baltimore’s Black-owned business community.

Her family and Ron Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University, agreed to name the center after LaPere, saying it would keep her legacy and energy alive, Wyskiel said."

NEW YORK (AP) — Toy maker Hasbro said Monday it is cutting about 1,100 jobs, or 20% of its workforce, as the malaise in the toy business extends through another holiday shopping season.

The nearly century-old Rhode Island-based company behind Monopoly, Play-Doh and My Little Pony toys disclosed the layoffs in a memo to employees published in a regulatory filing. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

The company said that the reductions are on top of 800 job cuts that have been taken so far in 2023 as part of moves announced last year to save up to $300 million annually by 2025. As of year-end 2022, the company said it had 6,490 employees.

Like many toy companies, Hasbro is struggling with a slowdown in sales after a surge during pandemic lockdowns when parents were splurging on toys to keep their children busy. Last holiday season, many toy companies had to slash prices to get rid of merchandise due to weak demand. And the challenges have continued. Toy sales in the U.S. were down 8% from January through August, based on Circana’s most recent data.

“The market headwinds we anticipated have proven to be stronger and more persistent than planned,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks wrote in the memo. “While we have made some important progress across our organization, the headwinds we saw through the first nine months of the year have continued into holiday and are likely to persist into 2024.”

Cocks had said the toymaker will “focus on fewer, bigger brands; gaming; digital; and our rapidly growing direct to consumer and licensing businesses.”

Shares in Hasbro Inc. fell almost 6% in after-market trading Monday."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hunter Biden pushed back Monday against gun charges filed against him, challenging the case on multiple fronts as unconstitutional and politically motivated days after he was hit with new tax charges.

His defense attorney argued the gun case should be tossed out because an appeals court has found the law violates the Second Amendment under new standards set by the Supreme Court. Abbe Lowell also contended the charges against Hunter Biden violated immunity provisions that prosecutors agreed to in a plea deal they abandoned after Republicans slammed it as a “sweetheart deal.”

“These charges are unprecedented, unconstitutional and violate the agreement the U.S. Attorney made with Mr. Biden,” Lowell said in a statement. “This is not how an independent investigation is supposed to work, and these charges should be dismissed.”

The flurry of court documents comes as Hunter Biden faces charges in two states headed toward trial while his father, President Joe Biden, runs for reelection.

Prosecutors, for their part, have previously said that any immunity provisions are now defunct along with the rest of the plea agreement that imploded over the summer. Special counsel David Weiss didn’t immediately respond to Hunter Biden’s other arguments, which also include a contention that Weiss wasn’t properly appointed. The prosecution has until Jan. 16 to respond.

The original plea deal negotiated between the prosecution and the defense contained immunity provisions meant to bring “closure and finality” to the investigation and protect Hunter Biden from being charged for “the same conduct” if Donald Trump was reelected, his previous lawyer said in court documents.

Under the agreement, Hunter Biden would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax charges and avoided a full prosecution on a gun count if he stayed out of trouble for two years. He’s accused of having a gun for 11 days in 2018, a period where he has acknowledged using drugs. It’s illegal for “habitual drug users” to own guns.

Since its dissolution of that deal, though, prosecutors have filed three felony gun counts in Delaware and, last week, nine tax counts in California alleging he schemed to avoid paying $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019.

Republicans have said the new charges show the original deal was too lenient. Lowell, though, argued Weiss “buckled under political pressure to bring more severe charges.”

Firearm charges like those Hunter Biden is facing are seldom filed as standalone counts in non-violent offenses. An appeals court, meanwhile, has struck down the law itself, finding people shouldn’t lose their right to bear arms due solely to past drug use.

That decision from the Louisiana-based 5th Circuit came after the Supreme Court set new standards for gun laws in 2022, leading to upheaval in the nation’s gun-law landscape. President Biden called the Supreme Court opinion “deeply disappointing.”

The 5th Circuit ruling doesn’t directly affect Hunter Biden’s case since it was made in another part of the country, but the federal appeals court overseeing Delaware has made another ruling that people convicted of nonviolent crimes shouldn’t be barred from gun possession for life."

Authorities said a 2009 Acura sedan, driven by Courtney Dunston, was traveling north in the southbound lanes on I-95. The Acura eventually crashed head-on with a tractor-trailer near exit 67 in White Marsh.

The driver of the tractor-trailer, who was not identified, was not injured, but Dunston, 29, was pronounced dead at the scene. Roads were closed for about five hours as several agencies dealt with the crash.

The cause of the crash is under investigation, however state police say excessive speed and alcohol impairment may have contributed to it.

162,[Maryland] https://www.baltimoresun.com/latest-headlines/,Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton ‘day to day’ after suffering knee injury against Rams,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/12/11/ravens-safety-kyle-hamilton-day-to-day-after-suffering-knee-injury-against-rams/,"The Ravens defense might have caught a break.

Coach John Harbaugh said Monday that star safety Kyle Hamilton is “day to day” after exiting Sunday’s 37-31 overtime win over the Rams early with a knee injury.

ESPN reported that Hamilton suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament and the second-year safety would be week to week, though Harbaugh declined to confirm the nature of his injury.

“I’m not really getting into the diagnoses of what it was,” Harbaugh said. “He’s day to day.”

While it’s a relief for the Ravens that Hamilton has not been officially ruled out, losing him for any length of time would be difficult to overcome.

Without Hamilton on the field for much of Sunday after he suffered an injury on the final play of the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game later in the third quarter, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns before Baltimore eventually won in overtime on Tylan Wallace’s 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. Los Angeles receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua also racked up 115 and 84 yards, respectively.

It won’t help, either, that the Ravens play the Jacksonville Jaguars, San Francisco 49ers and Miami Dolphins in their next three games. The Dolphins and 49ers rank Nos. 1 and 3, respectively, in passing yards this season, while the Jaguars are ninth.

Hamilton, a 2022 first-round draft pick out of Notre Dame and Baltimore’s do-everything safety has performed at an All-Pro and Pro Bowl level in his second season, with 62 tackles, nine passes defensed, three sacks, a forced fumble and two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals on Nov. 16.

But after a 3-yard run by Rams running back Royce Freeman on the final play of the first quarter Sunday, Hamilton, who was not in on the tackle but was limping slightly earlier in the drive, went to the ground. He walked off under his own power with team trainers and went into the team’s blue medical tent before heading to the locker room.

Hamilton was initially ruled questionable to return but went back to the sideline to jog and returned to the field for the Rams’ next possession.

However, late in the third quarter with the Ravens trailing 22-20, Hamilton was again on the sideline and talking with trainers when it was announced that he was out for the remainder of the game.

Ravens wide receiver and Pro Bowl kick returner Devin Duvernay also exited the game with a back injury. Harbaugh said Duvernay will miss some time but did not specify a timeline.

“Devin might be a little more extended,” Harbaugh said. “He could be [out] more than a week.”

With Duvernay out, Wallace took over and delivered a game-winning return for a touchdown in overtime.

Asked if Duvernay is to miss more time if Wallace will be named the team’s punt returner, Harbaugh smiled and said, “I think he’s earned it.”

In another move, Harbaugh also confirmed that the team will activate cornerback Damarion “Pepe” Williams to the 53-man roster.

The second-year defensive back returned to practice late last month after being on injured reserve with an ankle injury that sidelined him for most offseason activities. The deadline to activate Williams is Tuesday, or else he would have to revert to injured reserve and miss the rest of the season.

With Hamilton potentially sidelined, Williams adds depth to the slot corner position, where Hamilton and veteran cornerback Arthur Maulet have often been utilized."
163,[Maryland] https://www.baltimoresun.com/latest-headlines/,What to know about abortion lawsuits being heard in US courts this week,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/12/11/what-to-know-about-abortion-lawsuits-being-heard-in-us-courts-this-week/,"By GEOFF MULVIHILL (Associated Press)

When the U.S. Supreme Court undid the nationwide right to abortion last year, it did not remove the issue from the courts.

Instead, it opened a new frontier of litigation, with states passing their own restrictions and opponents challenging them in courts across the country.

This week, three state courts are hearing arguments on abortion, including a request in Texas that could establish a new legal approach for women who are seeking immediate access to the procedure because of pregnancy complications.

Some things to know about the cases:

Most of the lawsuits that have been filed against bans and restrictions are seeking to secure general access to abortion.

But last week, a Texas woman pregnant with a terminally ill fetus decided not to wait for those challenges to be resolved. Saying that her condition poses a risk to her health and future fertility, she asked a court for permission to obtain an abortion immediately.

Doctors told 31-year-old Kate Cox that their hands were tied — despite the Texas law’s exception for when a woman’s life is at risk — and that she would have to wait for the fetus to die or carry the pregnancy to term.

A state district judge issued an order on Thursday allowing Cox to receive an abortion. The state attorney general filed an appeal, arguing that Cox’s situation does not meet the criteria for an exception. He also warned that anyone providing the abortion could still face legal consequences. On Friday, the state’s supreme court put the lower-court ruling on hold.

A pregnant woman in Kentucky is also seeking immediate access to an abortion, but the claim she filed Friday does not cite exceptions to that state’s law; rather it argues that the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy violates the state constitution.

Before Arizona was a state, it had a ban on abortion that was overridden by the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a nationwide right to abortion. Just before Roe was undone last year, lawmakers passed a separate ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

There’s been confusion and litigation over which law applies. Currently, abortions are available during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, based on a court ruling last year that said doctors can’t be prosecuted for providing abortions during this time frame.

The Arizona Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the pre-statehood ban of 1864 — which would prohibit abortions at any stage of pregnancy — should apply.

Meanwhile, Arizona abortion rights supporters are pushing to get a ballot question before voters next year that would undo both bans. Advocates in other states are attempting to put similar questions on the ballot following the success of such a measure in Ohio last month.

New Mexico is one of seven states that allows abortions to be obtained at all stages of pregnancy, and it’s become a major destination for people from states with bans, especially neighboring Texas.

That hasn’t stopped some conservative city and county governments in the blue state from passing local abortion bans.

The state’s Democratic attorney general is challenging those bans, saying they violate the state constitution’s provision prohibiting discrimination based on sex and pregnancy status.

Most of the local laws have been put on hold by the New Mexico Supreme Court while it considers the issue. The court will hear arguments on the challenge on Wednesday.

Two hearings before courts in Wyoming this week could shape litigation on the legality of abortion.

In July, Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens paused enforcement of a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy while she weighs whether to hold a trial on a challenge to the ban.

Owens is holding a hearing Thursday to choose between a trial or making a decision more quickly based on legal arguments put before her.

Prior to that, the state Supreme Court — whose five members were all appointed by Republican governors — will hear arguments Tuesday on whether to let two lawmakers and Right to Life of Wyoming intervene in the case. They contend that Republican state Attorney General Bridget Hill should defend the ban with evidence, not just legal arguments.

Hill said in a court filing that while she doesn’t object to parties being added, the case should be decided solely on the legal arguments.

The state has just one clinic that provides abortions with both medication and surgery. The Casper clinic opened in April, after a nearly yearlong delay because of damage from an arson attack. A second, in Jackson, which provides only medication abortion, has said it is closing this week because of high rent and other costs.

On Monday, Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the last piece of a legislative package known as the Reproductive Health Act. The package aims to reinforce and safeguard abortion rights in Michigan after voters last year approved a ballot initiative enshrining the right in the state’s constitution.

The bill repeals a law that had banned insurance coverage for abortion without purchase of a separate rider. The law, coined “rape insurance” by opponents, was passed exactly 10 years ago by a state Legislature that was controlled by Republicans.

He asks lots of “why” questions that don’t always coincide with the current conversation, but are about a previous topic.

His two reading teachers have said that he is disrespectful and does not participate enough in class.

We have talked about this — both with the teachers and with him.

He comes home with complete papers, does well on spelling tests and is above grade level on reading assessments.

What they say and what we see coming home doesn’t make sense.

We have asked for examples of situations when he’s disrespectful so we can talk to him about it, but the teachers become vague and won’t give an example.

His other teachers say he is kind and helpful, while also being a bit too talkative, but they say he is on track and doing well.

We want to help solve the issue with his reading teachers, but can’t seem to get straight answers.

He comes home crying sometimes because his reading teachers seem to react so negatively to him.

He’s a good kid (an only child) and we don’t feel he’s disrespectful at home.

He is very creative, artistic, and generally a happy and easygoing boy.

Any advice on how to tackle this?

My mother-in-law says to just let it go because he’s fine, but I don’t know.

I’m worried that I’m just not seeing something, and this is uncharted territory for me.

— Uncharted

Dear Uncharted: Your son’s teachers are telling you that your son has problems — or creates problems — in their classroom.

Without details or examples, you don’t have any way to coach your son toward improved behavior. It is ironic (to say the least) that his reading teachers communicate so poorly.

You should start by emailing both of the teachers. Thank them for teaching your son and explain simply and briefly that you are eager to help resolve some of the issues they’ve raised. You might engage them more thoroughly if you basically throw yourself on their mercy by adding something like, “We are first-time parents and he is our only child, so we don’t have any prior experience dealing with educational or learning problems. We really want to help him succeed, so please detail very plainly and specifically any behavior which you believe needs correction. We welcome your specific suggestions and guidance for how to help him to be the respectful and engaged pupil you deserve to teach.”

After this blatant appeal for help, you should also kick this issue upstairs to the academic counselor and/or principal. Meeting personally with these educators would help to give you a game plan, and it could also put the school administration on notice that these particular teachers are not necessarily setting your son up for success in school.

This is a critical stage for your son. He could emerge as a lively little boy who is excited to learn, or a frustrated child who doesn’t like going to school.

Dear Amy: I picked up my husband’s phone and found a private message to a woman he works with.

It started out “Hey, Beautiful.”

I looked up her profile on Facebook and under pictures she has posted of herself he was saying things like “absolutely gorgeous” and “beautiful.”

He had surgery and we both posted about the surgery on FB, but she messaged privately to ask him how it went.

I say she could have read it like everyone else and apparently she did because she left a heart emoji on his post.

He says this is all perfectly innocent and there is nothing wrong with it.

I say there is a lot wrong with it.

What do you say?

— Disgruntled Wife

Dear Disgruntled: I wonder how your husband would react if you were engaged in an analogous private communication with another man whom your husband had never met: “Hey, gorgeous!” “Hey, handsome!” “Hubba hubba…”

What matters most is not whether it is “wrong,” “innocent,” or somewhere in between, but how this makes you feel.

I suggest that you should discuss this, not by labeling the behavior, but by describing your feelings.

Dear Amy: Your advice to “Regretful” was backward. This older couple moved across the country to be with their children, and when they decided they’d made a mistake and moved back, you sided with their children!

— Upset

Dear Upset: “Regretful” made a hasty choice to move, and quickly reversed course. I appreciated that they took responsibility for the impact of their “pandemic panic.”

165,[Maryland] https://www.baltimoresun.com/latest-headlines/,NFL playoff picture: Breaking down the crowded AFC race with four weeks to go,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/12/11/nfl-playoff-picture-afc-breakdown/,"Just four weeks remain in the NFL regular season, which means it’s time to start thinking about the playoffs.

While the Ravens (10-3) have put themselves atop the AFC after Sunday’s thrilling overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams, there’s a crowded field forming behind them. Eleven AFC teams are above .500, including six with 7-6 records, but only the top seven will earn a playoff berth.

If the Ravens finish with the conference’s best record, they get the first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. If they finish behind the Miami Dolphins (9-3) — who host the Tennessee Titans on Monday night and travel to Baltimore on Dec. 31 — and still win the AFC North, there are several talented teams who could travel to M&T Bank Stadium for the wild-card round in January.

Here’s a look at AFC playoff picture if the regular season ended today:

1. Ravens (10-3, 1st in AFC North)

Remaining schedule: at Jaguars, at 49ers, vs. Dolphins, vs. Steelers

Playoff odds, per New York Times: >99%

What’s working: Just about everything. Reserve wide receiver Tylan Wallace cemented a wild 37-31 win over the Rams with a 76-yard punt return in overtime, helping the Ravens take a half-game lead over the Dolphins in the race for the AFC’s top seed. Lamar Jackson delivered in the clutch, leading a 13-play, 75-yard drive late in the fourth quarter capped by a 21-yard touchdown pass to rookie Zay Flowers. With Flowers thriving, tight end Isaiah Likely stepping up in Mark Andrews’ absence and Odell Beckham Jr. turning back the clock of late, the Ravens seem better equipped than ever to win in the postseason with Jackson under center.

What isn’t: The Ravens’ biggest problem all season has been consistency. They seem to play up or down to their competition, though Sunday’s win was perhaps the most encouraging yet because of the team’s ability to overcome its mistakes in a playoff atmosphere. After stumbles earlier this season in close losses to the Colts, Steelers and Browns, late-game execution remains a potential Achilles’ heel.

2. Miami Dolphins (9-3, 1st in AFC East)

Remaining schedule: vs. Titans, vs. Jets, vs. Cowboys, at Ravens, vs. Bills

Playoff odds, per New York Times: >99%

What’s working: The offense, which is perhaps the league’s best. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill is on pace to become the first player to reach 2,000 receiving yards in a season, and Miami is rivaling the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most yards per game in a single season with 428.4 entering Monday. Tua Tagovailoa is in complete command of coach Mike McDaniel’s scheme, ranking among the league leaders with 3,457 passing yards and 24 touchdowns in 12 games.

What isn’t: Mounting injuries. After losing budding pass rusher Jaelan Phillips for the season, the Dolphins placed linebacker Jerome Baker on injured reserve Sunday. Starting right guard Rob Hunt and safety Jevon Holland are also questionable to play Monday, and left tackle Terron Armstead has battled knee and ankle injuries throughout the season. Depth matters at this point of the season, and Miami’s will be tested.

3. Kansas City Chiefs (8-5, 1st in AFC West)

Remaining schedule: at Patriots, vs. Raiders, vs. Bengals, at Chargers

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 98%

What’s working: Not much right now. The defending Super Bowl champions have lost two straight and three of their past four after a hot start seemingly put them in the driver’s seat for the top seed. Patrick Mahomes has surprisingly been part of the problem, having thrown three interceptions over the past four weeks, including one that halted a promising opening drive in Sunday’s 20-17 loss to the Bills.

What isn’t: The refs? Mahomes and coach Andy Reid both criticized the officials for a rarely called offside penalty against the offense that negated a dazzling 49-yard touchdown on a lateral from tight end Travis Kelce to wide receiver Kadarius Toney that would have given Kansas City the lead with just over a minute to play. Frustration seems to be mounting for Mahomes, who was visibly angry after the game.

4. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-5, 1st in AFC South)

Remaining schedule: vs. Ravens, at Buccaneers, vs. Panthers, at Titans

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 92%

What’s working: Trevor Lawrence’s ankle, at least for the moment. After suffering what looked to be a serious injury in last Monday’s loss to the Bengals, the star quarterback started Sunday against the Browns and was understandably up and down. While he threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns, he was also intercepted three times in a 31-27 loss.

What isn’t: The defense. A week after being torched by Bengals backup quarterback Jake Browning, Jacksonville allowed 38-year-old Joe Flacco to throw for 311 yards and three touchdowns. The pass rush has been especially disappointing of late, recording just three sacks over the past two games.

5. Cleveland Browns (8-5, 2nd in AFC North)

Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, at Texans, vs. Jets, at Bengals

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 84%

What’s working: Flacco. Cleveland is 1-1 with the former Ravens star since he signed to the practice squad three weeks ago, and he’s earned enough of coach Kevin Stefanski’s trust to be declared the starter for the rest of the season over rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson. The Browns defense has been good enough to win with four different starting quarterbacks this season, but Flacco provides the kind of steady hand this team needs to get back to the postseason for the first time since 2020.

What isn’t: The offensive line, which entered the season among the league’s best. Injuries have created a revolving door at tackle, forcing unproven players Dawand Jones, Christian Geron and James Hudson III to step in. Center Ethan Pocic left Sunday’s game with a stinger, leaving guards Joel Bitonio and Wyatt Teller as the only healthy starters.

6. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6, 3rd in AFC North)

Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bengals, at Seahawks, at Ravens

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 25%

What’s working: After back-to-back losses to the last-place Patriots and Cardinals, bright spots are hard to find. The defense has been good, if not great, for most of the season, but allowing three touchdown passes to backup quarterback Bailey Zappe in Thursday night’s 21-18 loss to the Patriots is inexcusable. At least defensive signal-caller Elandon Roberts is back from a groin injury and playing well to lead a banged-up group of linebackers.

What isn’t: The firing of offensive coordinator Matt Canada hasn’t been the easy fix many fans were hoping for, as the Steelers are averaging just 14.7 points in the three games since Mike Sullivan took over play-calling duties. An ankle injury to starting quarterback Kenny Pickett certainly hasn’t helped. Backup Mitch Trubisky has posted a QBR of 35.3 this season, a mark that would rank above only Bryce Young and Zach Wilson among qualified quarterbacks.

7. Indianapolis Colts (7-6, 2nd in AFC South)

Remaining schedule: vs. Steelers, at Falcons, vs. Raiders, vs. Texans

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 41%

What’s working: A lot, at least before Sunday. The Colts had won four in a row (albeit against weak competition) to jump back into the playoff race before suffering a 34-14 loss to the Bengals. Shane Steichen is building a compelling case to be Coach of the Year in his first season with the way he’s squeezed the most out of an offense led by inconsistent quarterback Gardner Minshew II and missing star running back Jonathan Taylor.

What isn’t: While the defense entered Sunday with the second-most sacks in the league, it has allowed nearly 30 points per game over the past three weeks.

8. Houston Texans (7-6, 3rd in AFC South)

Remaining schedule: at Titans, vs. Browns, vs. Titans, at Colts

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 45%

What’s working: Rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud was averaging 295 passing yards per game before throwing for just 91 yards in Sunday’s ugly 30-6 loss to the Jets. The No. 2 overall pick has been sensational, but the hits are starting to pile up. He’s been sacked 35 times this season and is in the league’s concussion protocol after exiting in the fourth quarter Sunday.

What isn’t: Mounting injuries on offense. In addition to Stroud, breakout wide receiver Nico Collins left Sunday’s game with a calf injury in the first quarter just two weeks after standout rookie receiver Tank Dell was lost for the season with a fractured fibula. Tight end Dalton Schultz was also ruled out Sunday with a hamstring injury, and offensive tackle Tytus Howard suffered a season-ending knee injury two weeks ago. If Stroud misses any time, it’s unlikely backup Davis Mills can lead Houston to the postseason.

9. Denver Broncos (7-6, 2nd in AFC West)

Remaining schedule: at Lions, vs. Patriots, vs. Chargers, at Raiders

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 50%

What’s working: Lately, it’s been the defense, which is surprising to say after it allowed 70 points in a game earlier this season. But takeaways have helped turn things around. Since Week 6, according to ESPN, the Broncos have forced 18 turnovers and allowed 12 touchdowns. They’ve won six of their past seven games and have the second-best odds to make the postseason of the non-division leaders, according to NYT.

What isn’t: Russell Wilson bounced back Sunday after throwing three interceptions in a loss to the Texans, but he is not living up to the massive contract he received from Denver before the start of last season. He’s still capable of occasional moments of brilliance, though much of the credit should go to wide receiver Courtland Sutton, who made a brilliant one-handed grab for his 10th touchdown catch of the season in Sunday’s 24-7 win over the Chargers.

10. Cincinnati Bengals (7-6, 4th in AFC North)

Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, at Steelers, at Chiefs, vs. Browns

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 26%

What’s working: While the Bengals seemed hopeless after Joe Burrow’s season-ending wrist injury, backup Jake Browning has delivered two strong starts in a row to keep the team afloat. A lot of his 275 passing yards Sunday came on screens to running backs Joe Mixon and Chase Brown, but the 27-year-old former college star might just be good enough to help the Bengals earn a surprise playoff berth.

What isn’t: The emergence of the rookie Brown has been huge for the offense, which has struggled to run the ball for most of the season. The Bengals are averaging just 84.7 rushing yards per game, second-worst in the league, but Brown has averaged 4.8 yards per carry in a limited role and turned a screen pass into a 54-yard touchdown Sunday. He’s likely to receive a larger workload down the stretch.

11. Buffalo Bills (7-6, 2nd in AFC East)

Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, at Chargers, vs. Patriots, at Dolphins

Playoff odds, per New York Times: 39%

What’s working: Believe it or not, Josh Allen has been playing at an MVP-level for most of the season. The Bills’ record doesn’t reflect that, and Allen’s 14 interceptions are certainly unsightly, but he’s thrown 25 touchdown passes and rushed for a career-high 10 scores. Buffalo entered Sunday ranked third in offensive efficiency, per FTN’s defense-adjusted value over average (DVOA), and Allen is the reason why.

What isn’t: Injuries continue to take their toll on the Bills’ defense, which is already without linebacker Matt Milano and cornerback Tre’Davious White for the rest of the season. Pass rusher A.J. Epenesa exited in the first quarter Sunday shortly after batting a pass into the air and intercepting it, and safety Micah Hyde went down with a stinger late in the first half. There are also questions about Von Miller, who turned himself into police during the team’s bye week and is facing a charge of third-degree felony assault of a pregnant woman. It has often felt like a cursed season for the Bills, but perhaps Sunday’s huge win over the defending champs will be the spark they need."
166,[Maryland] https://www.baltimoresun.com/latest-headlines/,Orioles lease saga: Timeline of twists and turns in past year of negotiations,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/12/11/orioles-lease-timeline/,"The year is almost over, and along with it the Orioles’ current lease.

The agreement with the Maryland Stadium Authority that allows the team to play at Camden Yards expires in fewer than three weeks. Despite what seems to be continued progress toward a new deal, one has not yet been finalized, with a Dec. 31 deadline looming.

The final year of the current lease has brought with it plenty of ups and downs, including a misleading proclamation on the ballpark scoreboard, missed self-imposed deadlines and an agreed-upon deal put on pause on the verge of being announced. Here’s a look at all of the twists and turns the past year has brought in the Orioles’ lease saga.

Jan. 4: Ravens lease extension approved

With five years remaining on their lease with the MSA, the neighboring Ravens of the NFL agreed to an extension keeping them at M&T Bank Stadium through at least 2037. By doing so, they gained access to up to $600 million in public funds to renovate the venue, which would also be the case for the Orioles with a new long-term lease. Notably, the Ravens’ agreement requires that both teams using the Camden Yards complex receive equal benefits and treatment from the state.

Jan. 16: Angelos’ MLK Day news conference

Between announcing a $5 million donation to a local nonprofit and berating a reporter for asking about his family’s future owning the Orioles amid a legal feud, CEO and Chairman John Angelos reiterated the team would remain in Baltimore.

“We’re never going anywhere,” Angelos said, reiterating a comment he first made in September 2019 that the Orioles will play in Baltimore “as long as Fort McHenry is standing watch over the Inner Harbor.”

Angelos’ news conference also included him telling reporters he would invite them back to the ballpark the “next week” to “show you the financials of the Orioles,” a meeting that 11 months later has yet to take place.

Jan. 18: Moore takes office, ending Angelos’ negotiations freeze

In a Jan. 31 letter to Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, Angelos revealed that he paused lease negotiations with the MSA between when Moore won the gubernatorial general election and when he took office, a period of nearly 10 weeks as the agreement entered its final year. The letter between Angelos and Moore, who have a friendship predating Moore’s election, also included Angelos suggesting the parties agree to a two-year extension of the current lease to give them time to design a deal that included not only the ballpark lease but also plans to redevelop the Camden Yards complex and surrounding areas.

Feb. 1: Orioles turn down option for five-year extension

The original Camden Yards lease, a 30-year agreement spanning 1992 to 2021, included a one-time option for the team to extend the deal by five years. When the Orioles and the state agreed to a two-year extension in 2021, it also pushed back that option. On Feb. 1, the Orioles declined the option, leaving the lease to expire at the end of the year. A statement from the Orioles and Moore after the decision referenced plans for the eventual lease to also include plans to revitalize the ballpark and surrounding areas.

Then-MSA Chairman Thomas Kelso later told The Baltimore Sun he never heard from Angelos as the option deadline approached, only becoming aware the Orioles declined the option because “it didn’t happen at 11:59 p.m.” There was hope at the time the impending deadline would serve as motivation toward completing the lease, though the Ravens’ new agreement came with five years left on their previous one.

Feb. 6: Angelos family lawsuits settled

Days after the option deadline passed, the Angelos family’s eight-month legal battle came to an end, with the lawsuits pitting John Angelos and his mother, Georgia, against his younger brother, Louis, being withdrawn.

In his initial suit in June 2022, Louis Angelos claimed his brother was trying to take control of the Orioles with their father, Peter, incapacitated and potentially move the team to Nashville, Tennessee. A suit from Georgia Angelos not only disputed that claim but also stated that Peter Angelos felt the Orioles “should be sold on his death so Georgia could enjoy the great wealth they had amassed together.”

Feb. 17: Moore nominates Thompson as MSA chair

Soon after replacing Larry Hogan as governor, Moore also went about replacing Kelso as MSA chair — effectively the role as lead negotiator with the Orioles and Ravens.

To replace Kelso, who had been the chair of Hogan’s 2018 reelection campaign, Moore nominated his own campaign chair: Craig Thompson, an attorney at Venable LLP who formerly worked for the law office of Peter Angelos. Thompson told The Sun he didn’t have a personal relationship with any member of the Angelos family.

“This is an extremely important endeavor and one that I’m anxious to work with the MSA team and Gov. Moore and the Orioles to generate a positive result,” Thompson said.

Feb. 19: Angelos says new lease could be ‘All-Star break gift’

Amid a nearly 40-minute meeting with reporters at the Orioles’ spring training complex in Sarasota, Florida, Angelos said he hoped a new lease would be an “All-Star break gift,” meaning complete by mid-July. He repeatedly mentioned the idea of “live, work, play, 365,” meaning a redesign of the Camden Yards complex that would encourage people to visit throughout the year rather than only for Orioles and Ravens games.

“The actual facility use agreement, renewing a 30-year-old document, that’s really a minor sidebar,” Angelos said.

March 9: Angelos, Moore visit Atlanta’s ‘The Battery’

Moore’s first out-of-region trip as governor was to Atlanta, where he and Angelos toured the Braves’ Truist Park and “The Battery,” an adjacent development with shops, restaurants and more that serves as a potential model for the pair’s plans at Camden Yards. The next day, Moore visited the Orioles’ spring training complex in Florida, throwing the ceremonial first pitch ahead of an exhibition.

“I’m very confident that we are moving fast on this,” Moore said before the game. “It should not be lost on anybody that the first trip that I took outside of the state was down here, was to spend time with the Orioles, to make sure they understand how big of a priority this is for me and how big a priority this is for the state.”

July 13: All-Star break passes without new lease

Angelos’ hopes of an “All-Star break gift” didn’t come to fruition, another promise he failed to deliver. In a joint statement from Moore and Angelos issued on the final day of the midseason break, they said they were making progress on their “vision to expand and revitalize the Camden Yards campus” but provided no concrete details on where negotiations stood.

“We are determined to make it happen, and soon,” the statement read.

Days earlier, while in Seattle for the All-Star Game, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed little worry about the continued uncertainty.

“I have every confidence that there will be a resolution on these issues,” Manfred said. “They’ll stay in Baltimore.”

Aug. 11: Angelos’ asks come to light

Despite months of negotiations, little had been revealed about what specifically either party was seeking. About a month after the All-Star break, The Sun reported Angelos proposed receiving the development rights to parking lots A, B and C, which are shared with the Ravens and would require the NFL team’s approval to alter.

Throughout negotiations, Angelos also sought an additional $300 million from the state — on top of the $600 million in public funds that would be unlocked with a long-term lease — and proposed the Orioles not be required to pay rent.

Aug. 18: Ferguson expresses desire for separate deals

Although Moore and Angelos’ public comments around the lease were always about a deal handling both keeping the Orioles at Camden Yards and converting the surrounding area into an entertainment district, that plan wasn’t supported by all other Maryland politicians.

“I think it’s premature to talk about investments around the facility when we don’t have a partner that is committing to be there for the next 20 to 30 years,” State Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat who represents the stadium area, said during the Maryland Association of Counties summer conference.

Aug. 21: Angelos details plans to New York Times

As the Orioles’ surprisingly found themselves atop the American League East, The New York Times published a profile of Angelos in which the CEO mentioned possible outcomes of the team’s negotiations with the city beyond the entertainment district, including an elementary school in the B&O Warehouse, a health and wellness clinic, and internship programs for Baltimore youth.

While Angelos spoke of a bright future for the areas around the playing field, he also cast doubt about the Orioles’ future on it, saying the team could have long-term troubles affording the young talent it has collected.

“When people talk about giving this player $200 million, that player $150 million,” Angelos said, “we would be so financially underwater that you’d have to raise the [fans’] prices massively.”

Sept. 28: Angelos, Moore make midgame announcement as Orioles clinch AL East

With the Orioles six innings from clinching the AL East for the first time since 2014, Angelos and Moore appeared together on the Camden Yards video board, with a significant announcement on the screen below.

“Earlier today, the Orioles, Governor Wes Moore and the State of Maryland, and the Maryland Stadium Authority agreed to a deal that will keep the Orioles in Baltimore and at Camden Yards for at least the next 30 years!!” the announcement read.

Representatives from both the state and the Orioles declined comment, saying more details on the “deal” would be announced the next day. Moore, meanwhile, was seen on the Camden Yards concourse repeatedly celebrating that the agreement was for 30 years.

Sept. 29: Scoreboard ‘deal’ revealed to be non-binding memorandum of understanding

Despite the fanfare that accompanied the midgame announcement from Angelos and Moore, it was revealed the next day the “deal” celebrated on the scoreboard was a non-binding memorandum of understanding, with representatives from the team and the governor’s office acknowledging no lease was in place and that an extension of the current lease by at least a year might be needed to sort out remaining details.

The MOU laid out “key components” of a potential lease, which would be for 30 years. Those elements included the Orioles no longer paying rent to the state for use of the ballpark while assuming responsibility for stadium operations and management. The deal also included a development rights agreement, in which the Orioles would pay $94 million in rent over a 99-year term for the right to develop land surrounding the ballpark.

The midgame announcement — viewed by some fans as misleading — came together hastily, with The Sun later reporting that Moore initially planned to announce the MOU a day later, leaving several team and government employees caught off guard by the premature scoreboard reveal.

Dec. 7: Report suggests Orioles might be considering sale

With the Orioles’ lease in its final month, Bloomberg reported David Rubenstein, a billionaire Baltimore native and co-founder of the Carlyle Group Inc., is in talks to acquire the team, though it cautioned that those talks “may still fall apart.”

Days earlier, stadium authority Executive Director Michael Frenz said the development rights deal “is envisioned to be separate from the stadium-use agreement,” later noting that while the documents would proceed through formal channels separately, he expected they would remain on the same timeline. Asked what would happen if no long-term agreement or extension was agreed to by Dec. 31, he said the team and state could end up on a “month-to-month” lease.

“Certainly, we’re not going to kick them out on [Dec. 31] or Jan. 1,” Frenz said, reiterating in a subsequent statement that the MSA “is committed to finalizing a long-term deal with the Orioles.”

Dec. 8: Moore pauses lease deal

On Friday, the Orioles and the MSA had agreed to a lease, with elected officials being briefed on the details of the deal. But Moore paused the agreement when Ferguson continued to express concerns about the stadium and development rights being packaged together.

“Fundamentally, I believe that the long-term lease for the use of the ballpark should not be conditioned on whether or not a private owner receives a 99-year ground lease to develop land owned by Maryland taxpayers,” Ferguson said in a written statement. “This is more relevant today, as recent news has heightened uncertainties about the future ownership of the team,” referring to the Bloomberg report.

The tentative lease agreement featured some notable differences from the MOU announced in September. Under the lease, the Orioles would have had four years to decide on a development plan; if agreed upon with the state, the lease would be for 30 years, but with no development agreement, the Orioles would be able to end the lease after 10 years.

David Turner, Moore’s communications director and senior adviser, said in a statement that “the administration will continue to work to address those concerns with the stadium agreement that the Maryland Stadium Authority, the Moore-Miller Administration, and the Baltimore Orioles have put forth.”

Any lease would require extensive approvals. If the state and team don’t come to an agreement before the current deal expires Dec. 31, they would likely need to sign a brief extension.

167,[Maryland] https://www.baltimoresun.com/latest-headlines/,Baltimore's vacant properties plan,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/12/11/baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-to-unveil-3b-plan-for-vacant-houses-including-new-tif/,"Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott will unveil an ambitious $3 billion plan Monday to attack the city’s thousands of vacant properties, promising to address a decades-old problem with funding from a newly created Tax Increment Financing zone and a yet-to-be-secured state investment.

The proposal, which Scott plans to announce Monday evening alongside officials from the Greater Baltimore Committee and Baltimoreans United In Leadership Development, calls for a mix of public and private financing that would be used over 15 years to broaden the city’s existing approach to rehabilitating vacant properties. Scott hopes the plan can address 35,000 city properties during that span.

“This is not a problem of ‘Can it be done?’ ‘Does the city have the tools to do this?'” Scott said. “This is: ‘Do we have the capital to do it at scale?'”

Of the $3 billion investment proposed, $300 million would come directly from Baltimore — half from borrowing via a revived industrial development authority and the rest from the sale of Tax Increment Financing or TIF bonds. The TIF structure, typically used in Baltimore for new, high-profile development, would allow the city to borrow millions of dollars to help fund the acquisition, remediation and sale of vacant properties. The debt would be paid off with new tax revenue expected to be generated by the improved properties.

Unlike the city’s existing TIF districts, which have compact boundaries, Scott has proposed a noncontiguous TIF zone that would be spread across the city’s most vacant-prone communities, primarily in East and West Baltimore.

To bolster the proposed city investment, Scott will ask the state to contribute $900 million over 15 years. In a briefing with The Baltimore Sun about the plan, Scott’s top finance and housing officials said there are existing resources and allocations Baltimore receives from the state that could be made more flexible to allow the city to better leverage the money.

Many of Scott’s ideas rely heavily on the cooperation of state lawmakers, in particular a piece of the proposal that calls for giving Baltimore a share of the sales tax collected in the city. A 2% local share would generate enough revenue to pay debt service on $1.5 billion in other bonds to assist with vacant homes, Scott’s team said.

However, state lawmakers are expected to grapple with budget tightening next year as revenue falls short of spending plans. On Tuesday, state officials announced a $3.3 billion reduction in planned transportation spending over the next six years.

Still, Scott’s administration expects to make its requests to the state around vacant properties a centerpiece of its agenda for the Maryland General Assembly session beginning in January.

“I know that this governor, that our Senate president, that our speaker, that the secretary of the state housing community development team, understand the importance of this issue, and that we’ve been working and talking with them about that,” he said. “And that they will make a significant investment into this plan.”

Vacant properties have long been a persistent problem in Baltimore, where thousands currently sit empty. The properties are magnets for crime, and a Sun analysis found Baltimore’s vacant homes catch fire at twice the national average rate.

The danger the properties pose to first responders who battle the frequent fires inside has been apparent during Scott’s tenure. Three city firefighters died battling a blaze in January 2022 inside a vacant West Baltimore rowhouse. The building, damaged in a previous fire, collapsed on them.

In March of that year, Scott announced a $100 million allocation from the city’s federal American Rescue Plan Act money to be used for the rehabilitation of vacant properties and other housing initiatives.

Amid other pressing issues such as implementing a crime plan and managing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Baltimore, vacant properties haven’t often been the most visible piece of Scott’s agenda since he took office in December 2020. Yet, as he enters a campaign for reelection in 2024, Scott has touted a reduction in the city’s total number of vacant properties from 15,843 to 13,636.

The plan Scott will unveil Monday also calls for substantial private investment. The proposal relies on $300 million from philanthropic and community investments over the next 15 years. BUILD, a city-based group of congregations, schools and neighborhood associations working to improve housing, will join the GBC, a coalition of businesses and other city institutions, to collaborate on raising private funds, Scott’s team said.

GBC President Mark Anthony Thomas cautioned that private investment will not come overnight, but the group backing Scott’s plan and the proposed investment will help build confidence in Baltimore.

“What we have to do is send a signal that people are deeply invested in Baltimore’s communities, that there is a universal commitment to get us to a better place,” he said.

The Rev. George Hopkins, co-chair of BUILD, said the mayor’s plan would bring much-needed investment to neighborhoods that have been ignored for generations while allowing existing redevelopments to expand. BUILD will work with the mayor’s team to ensure development occurs without displacing residents, he said.

“This investment, our desire, intention and goal is that it benefits people who have lived in our communities, for many people generation after generation, and that as this change happens, that it benefits them,” Hopkins said.

Baltimore Housing Commissioner Alice Kennedy said the Department of Housing and Community Development is positioned to do the necessary work. DHCD already has the authority to do project financing and to issue loans for acquisition and demolition of properties, she said. Kennedy argued that other cities have had to create land banks or new authorities because they didn’t already have the necessary powers to tackle vacant properties.

An agreement between BUILD and GBC, however, does include a provision calling for an existing special purpose entity, such as the Maryland Stadium Authority, to help with the issuing of bonds. BUILD previously called for creating a new special purpose entity to assist with the vacant building problem.

Kennedy said Scott’s plan will build on the strategy the city already has employed in impact investment areas. In those zones, the city has offered a holistic redevelopment plan that includes demolition and stabilization of properties, acquisitions, live-work incentives, down payment assistance and home repair grants. The plan also includes funds for infrastructure in the neighborhoods around the properties such as light posts, sidewalks and alleys that have been neglected or fallen apart as blocks were abandoned.

The funding infusion proposed by Scott would allow the city to add a new tool to the mix: loans for developers, Kennedy said. Those funds could help to close the appraisal gap — the difference between the cost to renovate a home and the price a renovated home can command on the market.

Stephen J.K. Walters, Baltimore-based author of “Boom Towns: Restoring the Urban American Dream,” called the mayor’s plan “an incredibly complicated way of staying on the wrong track.”

“The first thing we have to understand about TIFs is they do not work,” said Walters, a retired professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland.

Even when subsidies help developments get built, the completed projects typically fail to spark development and investment elsewhere. That’s because the impediment to investment, which prompted the need for the subsidy in the first place, has not been removed outside of TIF boundaries, Walters said. Subsidies move revitalization and investment activity from one area to another rather than increasing the tax base more broadly, he said.

“The evidence on this is very clear from our own attempts and our own experiments,” Walters said. “This is not enough to stimulate a genuine renaissance in the city. It’s not enough to solve the disinvestment crisis that’s leading to all these vacancies and abandonments.”

If some of the loftier provisions of Scott’s plan come to fruition, specifically the state allowing the city to share in a portion of the sales tax, Scott’s plan also calls for property tax relief. The plan calls for a $1,000 cut on all owner-occupied properties in Baltimore. That figure would represent the greatest percentage for properties with the lowest assessments. About half of the city’s properties, those valued at $150,000 or less, would have an effective tax rate of 1.3% or lower, city officials said.

The proposed cut coincides with an effort by Renew Baltimore, with which Walters is involved, to gather signatures for a ballot question that would ask voters whether they want to step down the city’s property tax rate from 2.248% to 1.25% over six years. The petition effort, led by a group that bills itself as grassroots but has wealthy and powerful backers, narrowly failed to gather the necessary 10,000 signatures needed to get onto the ballot in 2022. Organizers already are gathering signatures for the 2024 election, however. Ballot questions in Baltimore almost always pass."
168,[Maryland] https://www.fox5dc.com/tag/us/md,Montgomery County weighs new bill that would give tenants right to buy rental properties first,https://www.fox5dc.com/news/montgomery-county-weighs-new-bill-that-would-give-tenants-right-to-buy-rental-properties-first,"If a landlord in Montgomery County decides to sell a rental property, should tenants get to buy it before anyone else? That’s an idea Montgomery County officials considered in a hearing Monday.

A new bill #38-23, called the Right of First Refusal to Buy Rental Housing legislation, would do two things: if the owner of an apartment building wants to sell, Montgomery County could get first refusal on the property, and it would make it easier for tenants to buy a building themselves.

Council president Andrew Friedson says that under the current law, the county has to lay out millions of dollars to buy a building, then sell it to a non-profit group or tenants.

But as affordable housing is top of mind in Montgomery County, supporters say this bill could help meet demand.

""We want to address preservation with all the tools that we can and make sure that we’re doing so in a thoughtful way that puts the county and our non-profit partners in the best position possible without causing overly burdensome and unnecessary disruption in a fragile housing market,"" said Friedson."

The heavy rain from Sunday ended as a brief period of snow overnight, say FOX 5's Tucker Barnes. Most of the snow that fell came overnight to areas north and west of the District.

Accumulations were mostly limited to grassy areas where a coating to about an inch was seen.

Drivers should use caution on the roadways and should allow extra time for the morning commute. Some streets and sidewalks will be slick during the morning hours.

The winter weather prompted many schools systems across the region to delay opening times. Here are the latest CLOSINGS & DELAYS for Monday, December 11, 2023.

A chilly and breezy rest of the day with winds from 10 to 15 mph and high temperatures near 43 degrees."

Just after 1 p.m. on Sunday, officers responded to the 1200 block of Mercantile Lane in Upper Marlboro after they were asked to conduct a welfare check.

When they arrived, police found an adult male and child in a car, both gunshot wounds. They were pronounced dead at the scene.

Police have not released many details yet, but say the car was found parked in the garage of the Kaiser Permanente Largo Medical Center.

A spokesperson for Kaiser sent FOX 5 a statement about the incident Sunday evening saying:

""We are working closely with Prince George’s County Police as they investigate a situation that occurred on our Largo Medical Center campus on Sunday, December 10. The Largo Medical Center remains open for care and will have normal operations tomorrow, Monday, December 11. Due to the ongoing police investigation, we are unable to share any additional information at this time.""

Police say at this time, it is believed that this was a domestic incident and there is no ongoing threat to the public. They have not confirmed the relationship between the man and the child."

According to the Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to a report of a crash at the intersection of Point Lookout Road and Pin Cushion Road in Leonardtown just before 12 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 10.

When police arrived to investigate, they found a car that had collided with a horse and buggy, which caused the four people in the buggy to be thrown out. The horse was killed in the accident.

The Sheriff’s Office says the preliminary investigation revealed that a juvenile was operating the horse and buggy, carrying three family members when the horse unexpectedly reared and bucked.

This caused the buggy to enter Point Lookout Road, where it was hit by a 2021 Toyota Tundra going south down the road.

The juvenile who was steering the buggy and one adult passenger from the buggy sustained life-threatening injuries and were taken to the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center for treatment.

Another passenger was taken to MedStar St Mary’s Hospital and an infant was transported to Children’s Hospital as a precaution.

Investigators say at this time, speed and alcohol do not appear to be contributing factors to the collision.

Anyone who may have witnessed the collision or any events leading up to it should contact Corporal Dale Reppel at dale.reppel@stmaryscountymd.gov or call 240-496-6694."
